  abstract = {A digital signature is a mathematical scheme for verifying the authenticity of digital messages or documents. A valid digital signature on a message gives a recipient confidence that the message came from a sender known to the recipient. Digital signatures are a standard element of most cryptographic protocol suites, and are commonly used for software distribution, financial transactions, contract management software, and in other cases where it is important to detect forgery or tampering. Digital signatures are often used to implement electronic signatures, which include any electronic data that carries the intent of a signature, but not all electronic signatures use digital signatures. Electronic signatures have legal significance in some countries, including Brazil,  Canada, South Africa, Russia, the United States, Algeria, Turkey, India,  Indonesia, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Uruguay, Switzerland, Chile and the countries of the European Union. Digital signatures employ asymmetric cryptography. In many instances, they provide a layer of validation and security to messages sent through a non-secure channel: Properly implemented, a digital signature gives the receiver reason to believe the message was sent by the claimed sender. Digital signatures are equivalent to traditional handwritten signatures in many respects, but properly implemented digital signatures are more difficult to forge than the handwritten type. Digital signature schemes, in the sense used here, are cryptographically based, and must be implemented properly to be effective. They can also provide non-repudiation, meaning that the signer cannot successfully claim they did not sign a message, while also claiming their private key remains secret. Further, some non-repudiation schemes offer a timestamp for the digital signature, so that even if the private key is exposed, the signature is valid. Digitally signed messages may be anything representable as a bitstring: examples include electronic mail, contracts, or a message sent via some other cryptographic protocol.},

Essential considerations for reviewers are highlighted, focusing on the evaluation of methodological rigor, the importance of replicability, and the validity of results when employing LLMs. We offer practical advice on assessing the appropriateness of LLM applications in submitted studies, emphasizing the need for transparency in methodological reporting and the challenges posed by the non-deterministic and continuously evolving nature of these models. By providing a framework for critical review, this guide aims to ensure high-quality, innovative research within the evolving landscape of psychological studies utilizing LLMs.},

A growing body of SDT research has gone behind the flash and spectacle on the screen to assess the psychological fulfillments and key experiences that account for much of its motivational pull. This work provides a blueprint of the specific experiences, content, and features that deepen fulfillment. As important, SDT offers a process model of how fulfilling experiences predict sustained engagement over time. The chapter beings with a review of the research on the motivational pull of video games, whose immersive contexts can provide rich satisfactions of basic psychological needs enhancing intrinsic motivation to play. It then turns to more traditional forms of entertainment media, discussing the recent work applying SDT to investigate a process model of engagement with TV shows, exploring how basic need fulfillments in narratives impact engagement. Finally, practical considerations as well as directions for future research are discussed.},

Results reveal three main influences on assessment identity: the policy context; teacher collaborative networks that build shared understandings and promote self-confidence in grading decisions; and inclusion of targeted resources. The findings can be used in the continuous development of assessment practices across pre- and in-service teaching.},

This structuring yields different domains of reflection (characterized by 15 categories of reflection) which are arranged in a non-hierarchical order. By means of the framework model with its structural elements and the categories of reflection, an elaborate understanding of reflection can be established, on the one hand. On the other hand, the model lays a basis for a more accurate analysis of reflections.},

The full range of Social Sciences Citation Indexed journals was surveyed through the Web of Science site, and a total of 71 research articles were selected for the review. The findings reveal that the most frequently reported advantage of the flipped classroom is the improvement of student learning performance. We also found a number of challenges in this model. The majority of these are related to out-of-class activities, such as much reported inadequate student preparation prior to class. Several other challenges and the numerous advantages of the flipped classroom are discussed in detail. We then offer suggestions for future research on flipped model activities.},

It explores the evolution of feedback influenced by technological advancements such as AI, focusing on their application to improve EFL college students' writing skills through peer assessment. Using a rigorous a qualitative-dominant mixed method approach by integrating both quantitative and qualitative data, the study contrasts the effectiveness of traditional peer assessment (group A) with AI-based assessment using ChatGPT (group B) among fourth-year students from two different contexts, namely the University of Diyala, Iraq, and the University of Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic. While group A shows consistent improvement in writing skills, group B demonstrates slightly lower scores but offers quicker, accurate, and more precise feedback. The results of the study reveal significant differences between group A, utilizing traditional peer assessment, and group B, employing ChatGPT for AI-based assessment. In both contexts, group A's students demonstrated consistent improvement in writing skills, with final scores ranging from 7 to 14~out of 15. Group B also showed improvement, albeit slightly less pronounced, with scores ranging from 6 to 12~out of 15. Teachers' evaluations indicated that while group A benefited from reciprocal learning processes (writing and assessment), and greater social and cognitive engagement, group B experienced more accurate, quicker, and comprehensive feedback during peer assessment process from AI, albeit with less emotional and cognitive engagement. Ultimately, both methods contributed positively to students' writing skills, highlighting the strengths and trade-offs between human and AI feedback mechanisms.},

Using a mixed-methods approach, data were collected from 476 teacher candidates via the Generative AI Acceptance Scale, the Ten-Item Big Five Personality Inventory, questionnaire and focus group interviews. Results indicate a moderate acceptance of Gen-AI, with significant differences observed between personalities: future teachers characterized by more agreeableness, conscientiousness and openness to experience exhibited higher Gen-AI acceptance across all sub-dimensions. While text-generation tools were widely used for academic purposes, creative applications remained rare. Participants expressed mixed emotions---ranging from enhanced productivity and empowerment to concerns about over-dependency and reduced critical thinking skills. These findings reveal critical gaps in Gen-AI literacy and underscore the necessity for targeted professional development programs emphasizing ethical and effective use. The study offers actionable strategies for educators and policymakers to harness the transformative potential of Gen-AI while mitigating risks, thereby preparing future teachers to integrate Gen-AI responsibly and innovatively into their pedagogical practices.},

In turn, this is key to both teachers' occupational well-being and positive student development. Nonetheless, an instrument assessing the profession-specific knowledge and skills that teachers need to master the social and emotional demands in the classroom is still lacking. Therefore, we developed the Test of Regulation in and Understanding of Social Situations in Teaching (TRUST), which is a theory-based situational judgment test measuring teachers' knowledge about strategies for emotion regulation and relationship management in emotionally and socially challenging situations with students. Results from three studies ({$<$}italic{$>$}N{$<$}/italic{$>$} = 166 in-service teachers, {$<$}italic{$>$}N{$<$}/italic{$>$} = 73 in-service teachers, {$<$}italic{$>$}N{$<$}/italic{$>$} = 107 pre-service teachers) showed satisfactory internal consistency for both the emotion regulation and relationship management subtests. Furthermore, confirmatory factor analyses supported the differentiation between the two facets of social-emotional competence. Regarding convergent validity, results from Study 3 revealed a positive association between the profession-specific TRUST and pre-service teachers' general emotional intelligence. Furthermore, small to moderate correlations with the Big Five personality traits provided evidence for the discriminant validity of TRUST. In Studies 1 and 2, we found evidence for a correlation with external criteria, that is, teachers with higher test scores reported providing more emotional support for students and having better teacher-student relationships. For teachers' occupational well-being, we found a link with symptoms of depersonalization and job satisfaction, but none for emotional exhaustion. We will discuss the use of TRUST in research, for the evaluation of interventions, in teacher education, and professional development and will illustrate ideas for enhancing the tool.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

This study evaluates the effectiveness of LLMs in classifying and generating educational-type questions. We assessed ChatGPT's performance using a dataset of 4,959 user-generated questions labeled into ten categories, employing various prompting techniques and aggregating results with a voting method to enhance robustness. Additionally, we evaluated ChatGPT's accuracy in generating type-specific questions from 100 reading sections sourced from five online textbooks, which were manually reviewed by human evaluators. We also generated questions based on learning objectives and compared their quality to those crafted by human experts, with evaluations by experts and crowdsourced participants. Our findings reveal that ChatGPT achieved a macro-average F1-score of 0.57 in zero-shot classification, improving to 0.70 when combined with a Random Forest classifier using embeddings. The most effective prompting technique was zero-shot with added definitions, while few-shot and few-shot + Chain of Thought approaches underperformed. The voting method enhanced robustness in classification. In generating type-specific questions, ChatGPT's accuracy was lower than anticipated. However, quality differences between ChatGPT-generated and human-generated questions were not statistically significant, indicating ChatGPT's potential for educational content creation. This study underscores the transformative potential of LLMs in educational practices. By effectively classifying and generating high-quality educational questions, LLMs can reduce the workload on educators and enable personalized learning experiences.},

  abstract = {Replication is central to scientific progress. Because of widely reported replication failures, replication has received increased attention in psychology, sociology, education, management, and related fields in recent years. Replication studies have generally been assessed dichotomously, designated either a ``success'' or ``failure'' based entirely on the outcome of a null hypothesis significance test (i.e., pp {$>$} .05, respectively). However, alternative definitions of success depend on researchers' goals for the replication. Previous work on alternative definitions for success has focused on the analysis phase of replication. However, the design of the replication is also important, as emphasized with the adage, ``an ounce of prevention is better than a pound of cure.'' One critical component of design often ignored or oversimplified in replication studies is sample size planning, indeed, the details here are crucial. Sample size planning for replication studies should correspond to the method by which success will be evaluated. Researchers have received little guidance, some of which is misguided, on sample size planning for replication goals other than the aforementioned dichotomous null hypothesis significance testing approach. In this article, we describe four different replication goals. Then, we formalize sample size planning methods for each of the four goals. This article aims to provide clarity on the procedures for sample size planning for each goal, with examples and syntax provided to show how each procedure can be used in practice.

Therefore, Hoover-Dempsey's framework on parental involvement in homework will be updated with more recent findings from the international scientific literature. When parents facilitate, structure or emotionally support the homework process and, as such, are not actively involved in assisting in homework tasks, then the literature indicates indecisive or negative results. However, when parents are directly involved in assisting their children during homework tasks, then positive correlations were found throughout the literature, in particular when parents engage in meta-strategies or support the child's understanding of homework. While policy is primarily focused on providing instruments for parents to facilitate or structure the homework process, the current review suggests that parents need to be better informed on specific strategies that accommodate the student's need when assisting in homework tasks in order to improve achievements.},

Overall, math anxiety causes an ``affective drop,'' a decline in performance when math is performed under timed, high-stakes conditions, both in laboratory tests as well as in educational settings. This means that math achievement and proficiency scores for math-anxious individuals are underestimates of true ability. The primary cognitive impact of math anxiety is on working memory, particularly problematic given the important role working memory plays in math performance. The authors conclude with a discussion of risk factors for math anxiety and some factors to be kept in mind when working with math-anxious students.

This study investigated the potential of TTRPGs to provide a safe space where autistic adults could develop relationships with others while also engaging in character and world-building. Eight autistic adults were split into two groups and taken through a 6-week online Dungeons and Dragons campaign run by one of the researchers. Semi-structured interviews were then conducted to discuss how participants felt interacting in and out of the TTRPG. Several key themes were identified as important aspects of why autistic people could benefit from role-playing environments. The analysis showed that the participants felt a strong level of enjoyment from engaging in tabletop role-playing and, in many ways, experienced better social interactions during the TTRPG. The results suggested that TTRPGs can provide a safe space for autistic adults to engage in meaningful social interactions with like-minded individuals. Role-playing may also allow autistic participants to rewrite their own life stories through their characters' adventures, leading to improved self-esteem. Lay abstract Tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs) are popular hobbies that may offer specific social benefits for autistic people. This study investigated the ability of TTRPGs to provide a safe space where autistic adults could develop relationships with other autistic adults while engaging in character and world-building. A group of eight autistic adults were split into two groups and taken through a short-form online Dungeons and Dragons campaign over 6 weeks run by one of the researchers. The researcher then led a series of individual semi-structured interviews discussing how participants felt interacting in and out of the TTRPG. Several key themes were identified as important aspects of why autistic people could benefit from such an environment. Analysis showed that while real-life interactions could be challenging, in TTRPG play, they felt they experienced significantly fewer struggles. Results suggested that TTRPGs can provide a safe space environment where autistic adults can engage in productive social interactions with like-minded individuals. It also may allow autistic participants to experience `bleed' or the ability to take on a new character that changes the way they feel about themselves outside of the game. Future directions for this work are discussed.},

Worked-examples research is a cognitive-experimental program that has relevance to classroom instruction and the broader educational research community. A framework for organizing the findings of this research is proposed, leading to instructional design principles. For instance, one instructional design principle suggests that effective examples have highly integrated components. They employ multiple modalities in presentation and emphasize conceptual structure by labeling or segmenting. At the lesson level, effective instruction employs multiple examples for each conceptual problem type, varies example formats within problem type, and employs surface features to signal deep structure. Within this framework, examples should be presented in close proximity to matched practice problems. Moreover, learners can be encouraged through direct training or by the structure of the worked example to actively self-explain examples. Worked examples are associated with early stages of skill development, but the design principles are relevant to constructivist research and teaching.

  abstract = {The most important stream of game developers' revenue is arguably via gamer's in-game purchases. Previous literature has identified a number of strong determinants of online purchase intention including values, consumer experience, lifestyle, security, perceived risk, information, and subjective norms and behavioural control. The present study examined the relationship between online mobile gaming addiction and loyalty towards purchase intention of online mobile game in-game apps. The present study comprised 430 students from two major Indian universities who completed a short 28-item survey focusing on three variables (i.e., addiction, loyalty towards online games, and purchase intention towards online mobile in-game features). The results demonstrated that (i) online mobile game addiction shared a significant positive relationship with online mobile game loyalty; (ii) online mobile game addiction had a positive relationship with the purchase of online mobile in-game apps, and (iii) online mobile game loyalty increased game users' intention to purchase online mobile ingame apps. The present study is the first to investigate loyalty and gaming addiction in relation to the purchase of in-game apps. Game developers will always want to facilitate loyalty among its clientele. However, if the engagement strategies used by gaming operators facilitate addiction as a way of increasing purchase intention of online mobile game in-game apps, this raises serious ethical questions which the gaming industry need to address as part of its corporate social responsibility strategy.},

  abstract = {Peer feedback is introduced as an effective learning strategy, especially in large-size classes where teachers face high workloads. However, for complex tasks such as writing an argumentative essay, without support peers may not provide high-quality feedback since it requires a high level of cognitive processing, critical thinking skills, and a deep understanding of the subject. With the promising developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly after the emergence of ChatGPT, there is a global argument that whether AI tools can be seen as a new source of feedback or not for complex tasks. The answer to this question is not completely clear yet as there are limited studies and our understanding remains constrained. In this study, we used ChatGPT as a source of feedback for students' argumentative essay writing tasks and we compared the quality of ChatGPT-generated feedback with peer feedback. The participant pool consisted of 74 graduate students from a Dutch university. The study unfolded in two phases: firstly, students' essay data were collected as they composed essays on one of the given topics; subsequently, peer feedback and ChatGPT-generated feedback data were collected through engaging peers in a feedback process and using ChatGPT as a feedback source. Two coding schemes including coding schemes for essay analysis and coding schemes for feedback analysis were used to measure the quality of essays and feedback. Then, a MANOVA analysis was employed to determine any distinctions between the feedback generated by peers and ChatGPT. Additionally, Spearman's correlation was utilized to explore potential links between the essay quality and the feedback generated by peers and ChatGPT. The results showed a significant difference between feedback generated by ChatGPT and peers. While ChatGPT provided more descriptive feedback including information about how the essay is written, peers provided feedback including information about identification of the problem in the essay. The overarching look at the results suggests a potential complementary role for ChatGPT and students in the feedback process. Regarding the relationship between the quality of essays and the quality of the feedback provided by ChatGPT and peers, we found no overall significant relationship. These findings imply that the quality of the essays does not impact both ChatGPT and peer feedback quality. The implications of this study are valuable, shedding light on the prospective use of ChatGPT as a feedback source, particularly for complex tasks like argumentative essay writing. We discussed the findings and delved into the implications for future research and practical applications in educational contexts.},

However, a key remaining question is how generative AI affects learning, namely, how humans acquire new skills as they perform tasks. This kind of skill learning is critical to long-term productivity gains, especially in domains where generative AI is fallible and human experts must check its outputs. We study the impact of generative AI, specifically OpenAI's GPT-4, on human learning in the context of math classes at a high school. In a field experiment involving nearly a thousand students, we have deployed and evaluated two GPT based tutors, one that mimics a standard ChatGPT interface (called GPT Base) and one with prompts designed to safeguard learning (called GPT Tutor). These tutors comprise about 15\% of the curriculum in each of three grades. Consistent with prior work, our results show that access to GPT-4 significantly improves performance (48\% improvement for GPT Base and 127\% for GPT Tutor). However, we additionally find that when access is subsequently taken away, students actually perform worse than those who never had access (17\% reduction for GPT Base). That is, access to GPT-4 can harm educational outcomes. These negative learning effects are largely mitigated by the safeguards included in GPT Tutor. Our results suggest that students attempt to use GPT-4 as a "crutch" during practice problem sessions, and when successful, perform worse on their own. Thus, to maintain long-term productivity, we must be cautious when deploying generative AI to ensure humans continue to learn critical skills.    * HB, OB, and AS contributed equally},

This article examines the role of self-regulation of learning on assigned homework. The findings reveal positive relationships between homework activities and self-efficacy, responsibility for learning, and delay of gratification. A positive relationship between homework and a range of self-regulation skills exists that facilitates academic achievement and performance. Homework assignments can enhance the development of self-regulation processes and self-efficacy beliefs, as well as goal setting, time management, managing the environment, and maintaining attention. Some educational programs may be inadequately attuned to the self-regulatory needs of learners that are vital for effective learning. Students engage in multiple maladaptive homework behaviors to cope with homework demands. Those maladaptive behaviors call for more self-regulatory learning training for students and educators. In addition, the author demonstrated how we can use research to transform the public view of homework, which will result in a more positive disposition of learners. This article provides a starting point from which to launch renewed efforts to continue examining the strengths and limitations of current homework practices.},

Using a unique dataset of all the New York Times articles published over a three month period, the authors examine the link between integral affect (i.e., the emotion evoked) and whether content is highly shared. Results suggest a strong relationship between emotion and virality, but indicate that this link is more complex than mere valence alone. Positive content is more viral (than negative content), as is content that inspires awe. But while sad content is less viral, anger or anxiety inducing articles are both more likely to make the paper's most emailed list. These results hold controlling for how surprising, interesting, or practically useful content is (all of which are positively linked to virality), as well as external drivers of attention (e.g., how prominently articles were featured). The findings shed light on why people share online content, provide insight into how to design effective viral marketing campaigns, and underscore the importance of individual-level psychological processes in shaping collective outcomes.},

In the classroom, it is possible to distinguish between time spent by students on-task and off-task. The former is the time in which the student is focused on the learning task; the latter is the remaining time in which they focus on other activities. Understanding the relationship between the two is a concern for teachers, especially for those who teach mathematics and other subjects that are often considered unattractive by students. Given the opportunity afforded by educational video games to motivate and engage math students, an educational drill-and-practice video game was used in this study to practice second-grade arithmetic and study the students' on-task and off-task behavior. We found that when practicing arithmetic using an educational drill-and-practice video game, time on-task decreases during an activity (30 minutes) as well as over the course of the school year (March to December). This study has implications for the length of mathematics classes at schools as well as the need to vary activities during a class.},

The first derives from constructivist learning theory, and the second from the instructional design literature. Constructivism comprises a family of theories but all have in common the centrality of the learner's activities in creating meaning. These and related ideas have important implications for teaching and assessment. Instructional designers for their part have emphasised alignment between the objectives of a course or unit and the targets for assessing student performance. ``Constructive alignment'' represents a marriage of the two thrusts, constructivism being used as a framework to guide decision-making at all stages in instructional design: in deriving curriculum objectives in terms of performances that represent a suitably high cognitive level, in deciding teaching/learning activities judged to elicit those performances, and to assess and summatively report student performance. The ``performances of understanding'' nominated in the objectives are thus used to systematically align the teaching methods and the assessment. The process is illustrated with reference to a professional development unit in educational psychology for teachers, but the model may be generalized to most units or programs in higher education.},

We propose that moral judgments are based, in part, on the degree of effort exerted in performing the immoral or moral act. Because effort can serve as an index of goal importance, greater effort in performing immoral acts would lead to more negative judgments, whereas greater effort in performing moral acts would lead to more positive judgments. In support of these ideas, we found that perceived effort intensified judgments of both immoral (Studies 1--2) and moral (Studies 2--7) agents. The effect of effort on judgment was independent of the outcome (Study 3) and of perceptions of the outcome extremity (Study 6). Furthermore, the effect of effort on judgment was mediated by perceived goal importance (Studies 4--6), even when controlling for perceived intentions (Studies 5--6). Finally, we demonstrate that perceived effort can influence actual behavior, such as the assignment of monetary rewards (Study 7). We discuss the possible implications of effort as a causal motivational factor in moral judgment and social retribution. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Although this result has been regularly cited in studies of expertise, it is frequently misquoted. It is often claimed that de Groot found no difference in the way that experts and novices investigate a problem. Comparison of expert and novice chess players on de Groot's problem shows that there are clear differences in their search patterns.

Mounting pressure from increasing tuition costs and free, online course offerings is opening discussion and catalyzing change in the physical classroom. The flipped classroom is at the center of this discussion. The flipped classroom is a new pedagogical method, which employs asynchronous video lectures and practice problems as homework, and active, group-based problem solving activities in the classroom. It represents a unique combination of learning theories once thought to be incompatible---active, problem-based learning activities founded upon a constructivist ideology and instructional lectures derived from direct instruction methods founded upon behaviorist principles.},

  abstract = {It is widely recognized that we need to know more about effects of class size on classroom interactions and pupil behavior. This paper extends research by comparing effects on pupil classroom engagement and teacher--pupil interaction, and examining if effects vary by pupil attainment level and between primary and secondary schools. Systematic observations were carried out on 686 pupils in 49 schools. Multilevel regression methods were used to examine relationships between class size and observation measures, controlling for potentially confounding factors like pupil attainment. At primary and secondary levels smaller classes led to pupils receiving more individual attention from teachers, and having more active interactions with them. Classroom engagement decreased in larger classes, but, contrary to expectation, this was particularly marked for lower attaining pupils at secondary level. Low attaining pupils can therefore benefit from smaller classes at secondary level in terms of more individual attention and facilitating engagement in learning.},

Our understanding of self-regulated learning has been informed by three schools of thought: (1) research on learning styles, (2) research on metacognition and regulation styles, and (3) theories of the self, including goal-directed behavior. Based on these schools of thought, a three-layer model is presented. The innermost layer pertains to regulation of the processing modes. The middle layer represents regulation of the learning process. The outermost layer concerns regulation of the self. Educators and researchers would benefit from an integration of these three frames of reference into a comprehensive model of self-regulated learning.},

  abstract = {Background Academically productive dialogue activities in classrooms aspire to be inclusive, such that students of all capabilities participate meaningfully and equally in discussions. Aim We empirically examine the extent to which this aspiration is achieved regarding students of different prior achievement levels. Sample Low- (N~=~33), mid- (N~=~90), and high-achieving (N~=~22) upper elementary students participated in whole-classroom discussions around texts, facilitated by six highly motivated, trained teachers. Method Based on a quantitative ethnography approach, we coded 5975 separate speech turns and compared aggregated differences across the three subgroups using Epistemic Network Analysis (ENA). Results Whereas no differences were found in amount of speech turns, statistically significant differences were found in the quality of participation: Low-achievers' discussion participation was characterized by recitation-style talk, reduced network connectivity, and repetitive loops, compared to higher connectivity and more complex argumentative reasoning in their high-achieving classmates' network model. A follow-up qualitative analysis uncovered some of the social dynamics behind this inferior participation pattern, and highlighted the potentially stymieing behavior of peers. Conclusion The findings underscore the need for more empirical research that takes into account differences in quality of student participation in dialogic activities and the reasons behind it.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Productive Failure (PF) is an instructional design that implements a problem-solving phase which aims at preparing students for learning from a subsequent instruction. PF has been shown to facilitate students' conceptual knowledge acquisition in the mathematical domain. Collaboration has been described as a vital design component of PF, but studies that have investigated the role of collaboration in PF empirically so far, were not able to confirm the necessity of collaboration in PF. However, these studies have diverged significantly from prior traditional PF studies and design criteria. Therefore, the role of collaboration in PF remains unclear. In an experimental study that is based on the traditional design of PF, we compared a collaborative and an individual problem-solving setting. It was hypothesized that collaboration facilitates the beneficial preparatory mechanisms of the PF problem-solving phase: prior knowledge activation, awareness of knowledge gaps, and recognition of deep features. In a mediation analysis, the effects of collaborative and individual problem solving on conceptual knowledge acquisition as mediated through the preparatory mechanisms were tested. In contrast to the hypotheses, no mediations or differences between conditions were found. Thus, collaboration does not hold a major preparatory function in itself for the design of PF.},

  abstract = {Background We investigate learner characteristics and learning processes in two instructional designs with preparatory activities prior to instruction: Productive Failure (PF) and Vicarious Failure (VF). The aim is to develop a first theoretical understanding of PF and VF learners that can inform directions for the design of adaptive support. Methods Based on an experimental study with 110 secondary school students in mathematics, we examine the effect of students' learner characteristics in PF (students generating own solution attempts) and VF (students studying these attempts). We assess the learning processes based on think-aloud data from 15~PF-VF-model-observer-pairs, analyzing frequencies and sequences of cognitive processes, using the HeuristicsMiner algorithm. Results Mathematical ability was related to PF and VF students' learning, prior knowledge and mathematical self-concept to their learning processes. While both groups showed large overlaps in the frequencies and sequences of learning processes, VF students displayed a more analytical and PF students a more solution-oriented approach to the task. Metacognitive planning and evaluation behavior was relevant for VF students' learning, depending on prior knowledge and ability. For PF students, it depended on mathematical self-concept. Conclusions PF and VF students' learning as well as frequencies and sequences of their learning processes relates to cognitive and affective learner characteristics. Metacognitive planning and evaluation behavior may require adaptive guidance specifically for learners with low mathematical self-concept in PF or prior knowledge and ability in VF.},

Using data from 317 studies, our research addresses this deficit by providing a comprehensive meta-analysis of the effects of flipped versus lecture-based learning on academic, intra-/interpersonal, and satisfaction-related outcomes in higher education. Overall, flipped classroom interventions produced positive gains across all three learning domains, and we found significant advantages of flipped over lecture-based instruction for seven out of eight outcomes (gs = 0.20--0.53). At the same time, there was substantial heterogeneity in flipped learning effects, and we identified several variables that influenced the relative efficacy of flipped versus traditional courses. Of the three types of moderators examined (contextual, design-based, and methodological), educational context (e.g., discipline, location) accounted for the most variability in flipped learning outcomes.},

Data were collected from a global sample of students (               n               \,=\,1147) subscribed to the first author's popular chemistry education YouTube channel. Participants were in secondary school or college and reported having learned science in a variety of contexts including completely online, blended, or completely in-person. The data collection instrument, an online questionnaire, was designed to detect both quantitative and qualitative changes in the use of instructional video. In addition, statistics for the overall YouTube chemistry education channel for 2018 through 2021 were compiled to provide evidence of video viewing trends with a large sample (98.6 million video views) over a timeframe encompassing before and during the Covid-19 pandemic. Findings indicate that students' personal use of video for learning science increased substantially during the pandemic. However, for the majority of teachers, the use of video to support online learning during the pandemic either remained the same or declined. Post-pandemic, students plan to continue using science videos for learning and want teachers to do the same.},

Ein abschlie{\ss}endes Fazit zeigt die Komplexit{\"a}t des Themas auf und pl{\"a}diert f{\"u}r eine interdisziplin{\"a}re Betrachtungsweise., The topic of teaching quality has so far been discussed theoretically, particularly from the perspective of educational science, and examined empirically from the perspective of educational research. However, it is not always possible to determine the quality of instruction independently of the subject matter in question, as is implied by an educational science or general educational science perspective. Nonetheless, the quality of instruction in a particular subject has so far been conceived primarily in generic terms. The question therefore arises as to how the quality of mathematics instruction can be conceived from a mathematics education perspective and what added value a subject specific perspective offers. This will be derived and justified theoretically in the context of the present study and substantiated with two examples - quality of instruction for mathematical argumentation and proof and of mathematics instruction in different contexts. A concluding conclusion shows the complexity of the topic and pleads for an interdisciplinary approach.},

However, several studies show deficiencies and a decline in beginning undergraduates' skills in mathematics in many content domains. However, it remains unclear whether they have improved in so-called process competencies like modeling, mathematical reasoning, or using different representations instead, because there has been a shift towards the acquisition of such in many recent curricula. We investigated this issue at a university in Germany based on data from a (non-standardized) mathematics entry test taken by 3076 economics students divided into different cohorts from 2012 to 2019. Using regression analyses, we found that, on the one hand, students' ability to carry out symbolic calculations decreased. On the other hand, their performance increased in some test questions focusing on other process competencies like reasoning, mathematizing, or using different representations, which have become common tasks at school due to a stronger emphasis on these process competencies after a curriculum reform. Our data indicate that this reform might have had the desired effect.},

Such a chilling effect is essentially a form of self-censorship in everyday digital media use with the attendant risks of undermining individual autonomy and well-being. This article combines the existing theoretical and limited empirical work on surveillance and chilling effects across fields with an analysis of novel data toward a research agenda. The institutional practice of dataveillance---the automated, continuous, and unspecific collection, retention, and analysis of digital traces---affects individual behavior. A mechanism-based causal model based on the theory of planned behavior is proposed for the micro level: An individual's increased sense of dataveillance causes their subjective probability assigned to negative outcomes of digital communication behavior to increase and attitudes toward this communication to become less favorable, ultimately decreasing the intention to engage in it. In aggregate and triggered through successive salience shocks such as data scandals, dataveillance is accordingly hypothesized to lower the baseline of free digital communication in a society through the chilling effects mechanism. From the developed theoretical model, a set of methodological consequences and questions for future studies are derived.},

Data on student engagement in class is gathered by class observation: time on task, their level of activity, and amount and variety of questions students asked.

  abstract = {Self-regulated learning (SRL) is a pivot upon which students' achievement turns. We explain how feedback is inherent in and a prime determiner of processes that constitute SRL, and review areas of research that elaborate contemporary models of how feedback functions in learning. Specifically, we begin by synthesizing a model of self-regulation based on contemporary educational and psychological literatures. Then we use that model as a structure for analyzing the cognitive processes involved in self-regulation, and for interpreting and integrating findings from disparate research traditions. We propose an elaborated model of SRL that can embrace these research findings and that spotlights the cognitive operation of monitoring as the hub of self-regulated cognitive engagement. The model is then used to reexamine (a) recent research on how feedback affects cognitive engagement with tasks and (b) the relation among forms of engagement and achievement. We conclude with a proposal that research on feedback and research on self-regulated learning should be tightly coupled, and that the facets of our model should be explicitly addressed in future research in both areas.},

Participants were three eighth-grade students enrolled in a learning assistance classroom who were of at least average intelligence but who were performing significantly below grade level in mathematics. These case studies document the processes by which these students were supported to self-regulate their learning in mathematics more effectively. We begin by outlining important instructional foci in mathematics education for intermediate or secondary students with learning disabilities, along with what research indicates are effective instructional processes. In that context, we introduce the theoretical principles underlying the instructional model used here---Strategic Content Learning (SCL). Based on analyses of case study data, we describe how SCL instruction was structured to promote strategic learning. Throughout the discussion, intervention processes are described in sufficient detail to be of use to practitioners.},

One hundred fifty-seven Year 10 students from two high schools participated in two quasi-experimental studies. The participants were divided into two treatment groups: one group learned targeted concepts using PF with GBL (PF-GBL), while the other group learned the same concepts using DI with GBL (DI-GBL). The results of the first study indicated that the PF-GBL group showed significantly higher learning gains than the DI-GBL group on explanatory genetics knowledge. In the second study, no group difference was found between the PF-GBL group and the DI-GBL group on learning genetics and relevant mathematical knowledge. Implications of findings, limitations, and future research are discussed.},

The effect size for cooperative learning on academic achievement was found to be d++ = 0.59 (95\% CI: 0.38 between 0.80) and the effect size for cooperative learning on attitudes towards mathematics was found to be d++ = 0.16. In terms of achievement, the effect size was found to be medium, positive, and significant, but for attitude, it was small, positive, and significant. As a result, cooperative learning was reported to be a more successful method than the traditional method with regard to both achievements and attitudes.},

The framework comprises three dimensions: a design dimension focuses on designing feedback processes for student uptake and enabling student evaluative judgment; a relational dimension represents the interpersonal side of feedback exchanges; and a pragmatic dimension addresses how teachers manage the compromises inherent in disciplinary and institutional feedback practices. Implications discuss the need for partnership approaches to feedback predicated on shared responsibilities between teachers and students, and the interplay between teacher and student feedback literacy. Key recommendations for practice are suggested within the design, relational and pragmatic dimensions. Avenues for further research are proposed, including how teacher and student feedback literacy might be developed in tandem.},

  abstract = {Knowing how students approach learning in higher education contexts is key to promote learning strategies that are effective in the long run. Previous research has concluded that students often use ineffective learning strategies but believe them to be effective---a phenomenon known as metacognitive illusion. In a bid to broaden the perspective on students' use of learning strategies, this study draws on the notion of self-regulated learning as a theoretical lens. A questionnaire, comprising both open-ended and closed-ended questions, was developed to gather data from 416 engineering students. The questionnaire was geared towards (1) mapping what learning strategies students use in a real-world setting, in real courses, (2) probing their metacognitive awareness of the effectiveness of various learning strategies and (3) investigating why students choose certain learning strategies. We also compared which learning strategies the engineering students chose across programs and types of courses. The findings reveal a complex picture of why students sometimes use seemingly ineffective learning strategies, and we conclude that this is not always due to metacognitive illusion. It is instead often linked to attempts to regulate behaviour, motivation and/or learning context, sometimes in response to the context. This study adds to the current HE research investigating students' abilities to reflect on, assess and take control of their learning in an effective way, confirming that students need explicit guidance.},

The flipped classroom (FC) is currently an innovative pedagogical approach that has high potential to transform the teaching of mathematics. In the case study described in this paper, we investigated one mathematics teacher's transformation of teaching in two mathematics classrooms through implementing interventions based on FC methods; furthermore, we identified several key points of FC design as well as challenges and opportunities afforded by teaching mathematics in FCs. The results of the study showed that the tasks posed by the teacher, the implemented discourse, teacher feedback and scaffolding, and the teaching--learning environment were changed in FCs, although the approaches used by the teacher to analyze the tasks and students' learning were similar to those used in non-FCs, which points out the strengths of traditional teaching approaches. The study indicates that although teaching mathematics in FCs created some difficulties for teaching, well-designed FCs offered a great opportunity to promote students' mathematical thinking and understanding. Overall, the results highlight that through FC, teachers can develop students' mathematical potential with FCs.},

Although we live in a digital age, the limited use of technology in education, particularly prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, and teachers' insufficient experience with online or hybrid learning and teaching approaches resulted in several countries being unprepared for education during the pandemic. The flipped classroom (FC) is an innovative pedagogy with the potential to engage students in mathematics education using hybrid education combined with online and face-to-face learning, which is especially important during a pandemic. However, despite the high expectations surrounding this innovative approach, to date, no systematic literature review has discussed the opportunities and pitfalls of FCs in mathematics education regarding pandemic-related issues. In the present systematic review, we aim to bridge this gap and highlight the importance of flipping mathematics instruction during the pandemic and beyond. The results, which are based on textual analysis of 97 eligible articles, demonstrate that FC is a promising pedagogy that has numerous benefits for mathematics teaching and learning, although it is not a panacea for pandemic-related issues, as it also has several significant pitfalls. Overall, if the mechanism of mathematics education is to be crisis-ready, we should learn from experiences during the pandemic. In this regard, the current review contributes to research in mathematics education with the aim of gaining insight into successful implementations of FC pedagogy, not only during the pandemic but also beyond the crisis era of a pandemic.},

Objective               To examine the association between video gaming and cognition in children using data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study.                                         Design, Setting, and Participants               In this case-control study, cognitive performance and blood oxygen level--dependent (BOLD) signal were compared in video gamers (VGs) and non--video gamers (NVGs) during response inhibition and working memory using task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in a large data set of 9- and 10-year-old children from the ABCD study, with good control of demographic, behavioral, and psychiatric confounding effects. A sample from the baseline assessment of the ABCD 2.0.1 release in 2019 was largely recruited across 21 sites in the US through public, private, and charter elementary schools using a population neuroscience approach to recruitment, aiming to mirror demographic variation in the US population. Children with valid neuroimaging and behavioral data were included. Some exclusions included common MRI contraindications, history of major neurologic disorders, and history of traumatic brain injury.                                         Exposures               Participants completed a self-reported screen time survey including an item asking children to report the time specifically spent on video gaming. All fMRI tasks were performed by all participants.                                         Main Outcomes and Measures               Video gaming time, cognitive performance, and BOLD signal assessed with n-back and stop signal tasks on fMRI. Collected data were analyzed between October 2019 and October 2020.                                         Results               A total of 2217 children (mean [SD] age, 9.91 [0.62] years; 1399 [63.1\%] female) participated in this study. The final sample used in the stop signal task analyses consisted of 1128 NVGs (0 gaming hours per week) and 679 VGs who played at least 21 hours per week. The final sample used in the n-back analyses consisted of 1278 NVGs who had never played video games (0 hours per week of gaming) and 800 VGs who played at least 21 hours per week. The VGs performed better on both fMRI tasks compared with the NVGs. Nonparametric analyses of fMRI data demonstrated a greater BOLD signal in VGs in the precuneus during inhibitory control. During working memory, a smaller BOLD signal was observed in VGs in parts of the occipital cortex and calcarine sulcus and a larger BOLD signal in the cingulate, middle, and frontal gyri and the precuneus.                                         Conclusions and Relevance               In this study, compared with NVGs, VGs were found to exhibit better cognitive performance involving response inhibition and working memory as well as altered BOLD signal in key regions of the cortex responsible for visual, attention, and memory processing. The findings are consistent with videogaming improving cognitive abilities that involve response inhibition and working memory and altering their underlying cortical pathways.},

We explore the use of LLMs for supervised text classification, specifically the application to stance detection, which involves detecting attitudes and opinions in texts. We examine the performance of these models across different architectures, training regimes, and task specifications. We compare 10 models ranging in size from tens of millions to hundreds of billions of parameters and test four distinct training regimes: Prompt-based zero-shot learning and few-shot learning, fine-tuning, and instruction-tuning, which combines prompting and fine-tuning. The largest, most powerful models generally offer the best predictive performance even with little or no training examples, but fine-tuning smaller models is a competitive solution due to their relatively high accuracy and low cost. Instruction-tuning the latest generative LLMs expands the scope of text classification, enabling applications to more complex tasks than previously feasible. We offer practical recommendations on the use of LLMs for text classification in sociological research and discuss their limitations and challenges. Ultimately, LLMs can make text classification and other text analysis methods more accurate, accessible, and adaptable, opening new possibilities for computational social science.},

  abstract = {This study explores the effects of the Big Five personality traits and threat of evaluation on divergent and convergent thinking in a sample of 82 UK students. Results showed that Openness and Extraversion predicted divergent thinking under both threat of evaluation and no evaluation, whilst Neuroticism correlated significantly with divergent thinking (negatively) only under threat of evaluation. However, mediational analysis showed that the effects of Neuroticism on divergent thinking under threat of evaluation were fully accounted for by Extraversion. Thus neurotics' divergent thinking was significantly more impaired because they were more introverted. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.},

  abstract = {Cognitive load theory suggests that effective instructional material facilitates learning by directing cognitive resources toward activities that are relevant to learning rather than toward preliminaries to learning. One example of ineffective instruction occurs if learners unnecessarily are required to mentally integrate disparate sources of mutually referring information such as separate text and diagrams. Such split-source information may generate a heavy cognitive load, because material must be mentally integrated before learning can commence. This article reports findings from six experiments testing the consequences of split-source and integrated information using electrical engineering and biology instructional materials. Experiment 1 was designed to compare conventional instructions with integrated instructions over a period of several months in an industrial training setting. The materials chosen were unintelligible without mental integration. Results favored integrated instructions throughout the 3-month study. Experiment 2 was designed to investigate the possible differences between conventional and integrated instructions in areas in which it was not essential for sources of information to be integrated to be understood. The results suggest that integrated instructions were no better than split-source information in such areas. Experiments 3, 4, and 5 indicate that the introduction of seemingly useful but nonessential explanatory material (e.g., a commentary on a diagram) could have deleterious effects even when presented in integrated format. Experiment 6 found that the need for physical integration was restored if the material was organized in such a manner that individual units could not be understood alone. In light of these results and previous findings, suggestions are made for cognitively guided instructional packages.},

There were two groups; an experimental and a control group used in the study. A videoCD offline mathematics lesson recorded by the teacher was the ICT instrument in this approach. The t-test was used to analyzed the data. Hence a major finding was that the experimental group had a mean gain of 28.60 as against 16.62 of those in a conventional class in their pretest-posttest scores. A major recommendation is that teachers should incorporate flipped classroom approach as it encourages direct involvement of students in the learning process.},

  abstract = {Students' engagement in a learning environment has been a crucial factor in evaluating the quality of learning and predicting their academic success. With technologies being more applied in science education for enhancing learning engagement, it is important to study how learning environments with different levels of technological engagement (LTEs) affect students' learning. Data were collected from 168 fourth-grade students, ages 9--10, divided into 3 groups of different learning environments: (1) game-based instruction (high LTE) and (2) video-based instruction (medium LTE) as the two experimental groups, and (3) traditional instruction (low LTE) as the control group. Students' learning was monitored with two tests: scientific concept test and the scientific argumentation skills test. Descriptive and inferential statistics including t-test, ANCOVA, and the Johnson-Neyman procedure were used to examine how different LTEs affect students' learning as a group and by level (high-, medium-, and low-achieving). Findings demonstrated that (a) three forms of technology-supported learning significantly improve students' scientific knowledge and argumentation skills; (b) higher LTEs lead to significantly better learning of scientific knowledge, except for some high-achieving students who can learn equally well in traditional instruction; and (c) higher LTEs lead to significantly better learning of argumentation skills across all students.},

Using a cognitive load theory-based perspective, we argue that the task complexity that learners experience is based on element interactivity. Element interactivity can be determined by simultaneously considering the structure of the information being processed and the knowledge held in long-term memory of the person processing the information. Although the structure of information in a learning task can easily be quantified by counting the number of interacting information elements, knowledge held in long-term memory can only be estimated using teacher judgment or knowledge tests. In this paper, we describe the different perspectives on task complexity and present some concrete examples from cognitive load research on how to estimate the levels of element interactivity determining intrinsic and extraneous cognitive load. The theoretical and practical implications of the cognitive load perspective of task complexity for instructional design are discussed.},

The ICAP hypothesis predicts that as students become more engaged with the learning materials, from passive to active to constructive to interactive, their learning will increase. We suggest possible knowledge-change processes that support the ICAP hypothesis and address the limitations and caveats of the hypothesis. In addition, empirical validation for the hypothesis is provided by examining laboratory and classroom studies that focus on three specific engagement activities: note taking, concept mapping and self-explaining. We also consider how ICAP can be used as a tool for explaining discrepant findings, dictate the proper choice of a control condition, and evaluate students' outputs. Finally, we briefly compare ICAP to existing theories of learning.},

There was a significant difference in learners' motivation in terms of attention between the video-based instruction and traditional text-based instruction. In addition, the learners reported that the video-based instruction was more memorable than the traditional text-based instruction.

  abstract = {Students in first-year university courses often focus on mimicking application of taught procedures and fail to gain adequate conceptual understanding. One potential approach to support meaningful learning is Productive Failure (PF). In PF, the conventional instruction process is reversed so that learners attempt to solve challenging problems ahead of receiving explicit instruction. While students often fail to produce satisfactory solutions (hence ``Failure''), these attempts help learners encode key features and learn better from subsequent instruction (hence ``Productive''). Effectiveness of PF was shown mainly in the context of statistical and intuitive concepts, and lessons that are designed and taught by learning scientists. We describe a quasi-experiment that evaluates the impact of PF in a large-enrollment introductory university-level biology course when designed and implemented by the course instructors. One course-section (295 students) learned two topics using PF; another section (279 students) learned the same topics using an active learning approach, which is the standard in this course. Performance was assessed on the subsequent midterm exam, after all students had ample opportunities for practice and feedback, and after some time has elapsed. PF students scored nearly five percentage-points higher on the relevant topics in the subsequent midterm exam. The effect was especially strong for low-performing students. Improvement on the final exam was only visible for low-performing students. We describe the intervention and its potential to transform large introductory university courses.},

  abstract = {The Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT) is a measure of analytical reasoning that cues an intuitive but incorrect response that must be rejected for successful performance to be attained. The CRT yields two types of errors: Intuitive errors, which are attributed to Type 1 processes; and non-intuitive errors, which result from poor numeracy skills or deficient reasoning. Past research shows that participants who commit the highest numbers of errors on the CRT overestimate their performance the most, whereas those with the lowest error-rates tend to slightly underestimate. This is an example of the Dunning-Kruger Effect (DKE). The present study examined how intuitive vs. non-intuitive errors contribute to overestimation in the CRT at different levels of performance. Female undergraduate students completed a seven-item CRT test and subsequently estimated their raw score. They also filled out the Faith in Intuition (FI) questionnaire, which is a dispositional measure of intuitive thinking. Data was separated into quartiles based on level of performance on the CRT. The results demonstrated the DKE. Additionally, intuitive and non-intuitive errors predicted miscalibration among low, but not high performers. However, intuitive errors were a stronger predictor of miscalibration. Finally, FI was positively correlated with CRT self-estimates and miscalibration, indicating that participants who perceived themselves to be more intuitive were worse at estimating their score. These results taken together suggest that participants who perform poorly in the CRT and also those who score higher in intuitive thinking disposition are more susceptible to the influences of heuristic-based cues, such as answer fluency, when judging their performance.},

It presents findings from teachers who took part in a funded project in England that looked at the nature of scientific methods in science investigations. Science investigations are an integral aspect of science education and, as such, are often included in high stakes examinations. Therefore, teachers need to have a good understanding of ~a~range of scientific methods and their purposes in science investigations. The framework was used to ask teachers to classify science investigations based on how they teach them. It was also employed to devise assessments to measure students' understanding of scientific methods. The teachers were introduced to the new approaches and their perceptions were gathered to understand if they supported this as a framework for their classroom practice. Evidence from the study suggested that Brandon's Matrix appealed to teachers as a framework for practical science in schools, and they see potential benefits for its use in the teaching, learning, and assessment of science. Findings from the study showed it appealed to the teachers as a tool for classifying scientific methods, and how they also recognized the importance of assessing practical work and had an appreciation of the constraints and drivers in the current curriculum and assessment requirements~in England. Implications for teachers' professional development are discussed.},

However, the false positive/negative detection of generative AI has been noted as a challenge. In this article, statistical experiments are conducted to test the chances of false positive and false negative detection of AI-generated text. It was found that the detected likelihoods of generative AI in articles' abstracts is much lower than that found in paragraphs taken from the literature section of the selected articles. This means that literature parts have higher likelihoods to falsely demonstrate AI-generated text. On the other hand, when genuine texts are compared with AI-generated texts, it is observed that there is a noticeable margin of overlap between their distributions and therefore type I and type II errors fall within the realm of possibility. We show that despite these challenges, generative AI like ChatGPT continues to be a promising tool for communication and information retrieval. However, it is vital to address the concerns regarding false detection of AI generated text and ensure that these models are used in ethical and responsible conduct.},

After applying our inclusion and exclusion criteria, we ultimately selected 25 relevant empirical studies. The entire paper is divided into two parts: the first part focuses on the bibliometric and contextual characteristics of the selected studies, while the second part examines the methodological and evaluative approaches used by researchers to assess the impact of technology on students' attitudes, beliefs, and academic performance in mathematics. Our findings show that a significant portion of the work in this area involves the use of interactive platforms such as GeoGebra and Kahoot. Moreover, the role of augmented reality in mathematics education has also been investigated to a considerable extent. High school-level content is studied more frequently than middle school content. Regarding methodological approaches, we found a noticeable lack of qualitative and longitudinal studies. Furthermore, there is a need to develop and validate measurement tools across diverse educational settings to ensure comparability and rigor. Finally, certain learning outcomes---such as retention, attitudes, and teamwork---are rarely assessed.},

The two types of internalization are introjection, which entails taking in a value or regulatory process but not accepting it as one's own, and integration, through which the regulation is assimilated with one's core sense of self. Introjection results in internally controlling regulation, whereas integration results in self-determination. An experiment supported our hypothesis that three facilitating contextual factors---namely, providing a meaningful rationale, acknowledging the behaver's feelings, and conveying choice---promote internalization, as evidenced by the subsequent self-regulation of behavior. This experiment also supported our expectation that when the social context supports self-determination, integration tends to occur, whereas when the context does not support self-determination, introjection tends to occur.},

Throughout this period, inquiry learning has been regularly criticized by scholars who favor direct instruction over inquiry learning. In this vein, Zhang, Kirschner, Cobern, and Sweller (2022) recently asserted that direct instruction is overall superior to inquiry-based instruction and reproached policy makers for ignoring this fact. In the current article we reply to this assertion and the premises on which it is based. We review the evidence and argue that a more complete and correct interpretation of the literature demonstrates that inquiry-based instruction produces better overall results for acquiring conceptual knowledge than does direct instruction. We show that this conclusion holds for controlled, correlational, and program-based studies. We subsequently argue that inquiry-based and direct instruction each have their specific virtues and disadvantages and that the effectiveness of each approach depends on moderating factors such as the learning goal, the domain involved, and students' prior knowledge and other student characteristics. Furthermore, inquiry-based instruction is most effective when supplemented with guidance that can be personalized based on these moderating factors and can even involve providing direct instruction. Therefore, we posit that a combination of inquiry and direct instruction may often be the best approach to support student learning. We conclude that policy makers rightfully advocate inquiry-based instruction, particularly when students' investigations are supplemented with direct instruction at appropriate junctures.},

  abstract = {It is widely believed that there are educational benefits to making computer games, but there is no systematic review of research on this topic. This article describes a meta-synthesis of research on children designing and programming computer games that investigates the extent to which there is evidence of benefits for computer science learning and motivation. Over 400 articles were identified, and 68 articles met the inclusion criteria. A systematic analysis and synthesis across studies showed some evidence that computer game design and programming can lead to changes in programming knowledge, problem solving, and computer science attitudes and confidence. However, most of the evidence described engagement in computing-related practices and did not measure learning. The findings were mostly positive, although several studies noted more negative attitudes toward programming after making games. The results were similar across different pedagogical approaches, although social interaction may provide unique opportunities for computer science learning. The synthesis resulted in a list of design elements for studying computer game design and programming activities; these can be used to increase the availability of evidence about learning. The article concludes with the identification of gaps in the research and suggestions for additional research.},

  abstract = {Significance             Despite active learning being recognized as a superior method of instruction in the classroom, a major recent survey found that most college STEM instructors still choose traditional teaching methods. This article addresses the long-standing question of why students and faculty remain resistant to active learning. Comparing passive lectures with active learning using a randomized experimental approach and identical course materials, we find that students in the active classroom learn more, but they feel like they learn less. We show that this negative correlation is caused in part by the increased cognitive effort required during active learning. Faculty who adopt active learning are encouraged to intervene and address this misperception, and we describe a successful example of such an intervention.           ,              We compared students' self-reported perception of learning with their actual learning under controlled conditions in large-enrollment introductory college physics courses taught using 1) active instruction (following best practices in the discipline) and 2) passive instruction (lectures by experienced and highly rated instructors). Both groups received identical class content and handouts, students were randomly assigned, and the instructor made no effort to persuade students of the benefit of either method. Students in active classrooms learned more (as would be expected based on prior research), but their perception of learning, while positive, was lower than that of their peers in passive environments. This suggests that attempts to evaluate instruction based on students' perceptions of learning could inadvertently promote inferior (passive) pedagogical methods. For instance, a superstar lecturer could create such a positive feeling of learning that students would choose those lectures over active learning. Most importantly, these results suggest that when students experience the increased cognitive effort associated with active learning, they initially take that effort to signify poorer learning. That disconnect may have a detrimental effect on students' motivation, engagement, and ability to self-regulate their own learning. Although students can, on their own, discover the increased value of being actively engaged during a semester-long course, their learning may be impaired during the initial part of the course. We discuss strategies that instructors can use, early in the semester, to improve students' response to being actively engaged in the classroom.},

  author = {Deterding, Sebastian and Dixon, Dan and Khaled, Rilla and Nacke, Lennart},
  abstract = {Recent years have seen a rapid proliferation of mass-market consumer software that takes inspiration from video games. Usually summarized as ``gamification'', this trend connects to a sizeable body of existing concepts and research in humancomputer interaction and game studies, such as serious games, pervasive games, alternate reality games, or playful design. However, it is not clear how ``gamification'' relates to these, whether it denotes a novel phenomenon, and how to define it. Thus, in this paper we investigate ``gamification'' and the historical origins of the term in relation to precursors and similar concepts. It is suggested that ``gamified'' applications provide insight into novel, gameful phenomena complementary to playful phenomena. Based on our research, we propose a definition of ``gamification'' as the use of game design elements in non-game contexts.},

To consider this trend, this article presents the results of a differentiated meta-analysis of 48 treatment comparisons resulting from 30 articles on enhancing self-regulated learning amongst primary school students. Based on recent models of self-regulated learning, which consider motivational, as well as cognitive, and metacognitive aspects [Boekaerts, M. (1999). Self-regulated learning: Where we are today. International Journal of Educational research, 31(6), 445--457], the effects of self-regulated learning on academic achievement, on cognitive and metacognitive strategy application, as well as on motivation were analyzed. As the results show, self-regulated learning training programmes proved to be effective, even at primary school level. Subsequent analysis tested for the effects of several moderator variables, which consisted of study features and training characteristics. Regarding factors that concern the content of the treatment, the impact of the theoretical background that underlies the intervention was tested, as well as the type of cognitive, metacognitive, or motivational strategy which were instructed, and if group work was used as instruction method. Training context related factors, which were included in the analyses consisted of students' grade level, the length of the training, if teachers or researchers directed the intervention, as well as the school subject in which context the training took place. Following the results of these analyses, a list with the most effective training characteristics was provided.},

We conducted a field study with 460 undergraduates in an Applied Science course using a video player designed for active viewing to evaluate how students engage in passive and active video-based learning. The concept of active viewing, and the role of interactive, constructive, active, and passive behaviors in videobased learning, can be implemented in the design and evaluation of video players.},

Previous research examining active learning definitions in STEM fields found that the vast majority of published articles did not define active learning, and those that did defined active learning as interacting, engaging, or not lecturing. The current research extends this STEM-focused work by examining both social science and STEM science publications. A restricted systematic review of literature was conducted using the SCOPUS database, resulting in 547 relevant articles focused on active learning from 2017 to 2022. An examination of the articles indicated that 71\% of the reviewed articles did not define active learning and that the instructional strategies most often cited as fostering active learning emphasized social interactive learning strategies (e.g., small groups, team-based learning, discussion, and cooperative learning), as well as critical thinking strategies (e.g., problem-based learning, case-based learning, and inquiry-based learning). In addition, an in-depth qualitative analysis of the 161 definitions provided within the articles yielded three main emergent themes: (a) active learning is defined as grounded in student-centered constructivist theory, (b) active learning is defined as promoting higher-order thinking and deep learning, and (c) active learning is defined as an instructional strategy involving activity, participation, and engagement. Given these main findings, a representative definition was created: Active learning is a student-centered approach to the construction of knowledge focused on activities and strategies that foster higher-order thinking.},

  abstract = {Peer assessment has been the subject of considerable research interest over the last three decades, with numerous educational researchers advocating for the integration of peer assessment into schools and instructional practice. Research synthesis in this area has, however, largely relied on narrative reviews to evaluate the efficacy of peer assessment. Here, we present a meta-analysis (54 studies, k = 141) of experimental and quasi-experimental studies that evaluated the effect of peer assessment on academic performance in primary, secondary, or tertiary students across subjects and domains. An overall small to medium effect of peer assessment on academic performance was found (g = 0.31, p {$<$} .001). The results suggest that peer assessment improves academic performance compared with no assessment (g = 0.31, p = .004) and teacher assessment (g = 0.28, p = .007), but was not significantly different in its effect from self-assessment (g = 0.23, p = .209). Additionally, meta-regressions examined the moderating effects of several feedback and educational characteristics (e.g., online vs offline, frequency, education level). Results suggested that the effectiveness of peer assessment was remarkably robust across a wide range of contexts. These findings provide support for peer assessment as a formative practice and suggest several implications for the implementation of peer assessment into the classroom.},

  abstract = {Teachers notice through the lens of their professional knowledge and views. This study hence focuses not solely on teachers' noticing, but also on their knowledge and views, which allows insight into how noticing is informed and shaped by professional knowledge. As a discipline-specific perspective for noticing we chose dealing with multiple representations, since they play a double role for learning mathematics: On the one hand they are essential for mathematical understanding, but on the other hand they can also be an obstruction for learning. This comparative study takes into account pre-service as well as in-service teachers in order to explore the role of teaching experience for such professional knowledge, views and noticing. The participants answered a questionnaire addressing different components of specific knowledge and views. For eliciting the teachers' theme-specific noticing, vignette-based questions were used. The data analysis was done mainly by quantitative methods, but was complemented by a qualitative in-depth analysis focusing on how the teachers' theme-specific noticing was informed by different components of their professional knowledge. The results suggest that pre-service as well as in-service teachers do not fully understand the key role of multiple representations for learning mathematics in the sense of their discipline-specific significance. The participating in-service teachers distinguished themselves however from the pre-service teachers especially regarding their theme-specific noticing. Moreover, the evidence indicates that teachers' noticing of critical instances of dealing with multiple representations draws on situated as well as on global knowledge and views.},

However, the hallmark of human nature is how much of a person's identity is not built in; rather, it is humans' great capacity to adapt, change, and grow. This nature versus nurture debate matters---not only to students of human nature---but to everyone. It matters whether people believe that their core qualities are fixed by nature (an entity theory, or fixed mindset) or whether they believe that their qualities can be developed (an incremental theory, or growth mindset). In this article, I show that an emphasis on growth not only increases intellectual achievement but can also advance conflict resolution between long-standing adversaries, decrease even chronic aggression, foster cross-race relations, and enhance willpower. I close by returning to human nature and considering how it is best conceptualized and studied. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

A field experiment was conducted to assess the relation of computer-generated feedback to an individual's task performance. Sixty male and female magazine subscription processors working with assigned goals received either specific or general feedback from a computer monitoring system. This feedback was presented to the worker by a supervisor or self-generated by the worker using the computer system. The results demonstrate that feedback source (self versus supervisor) and specificity (general versus specific) were directly related to performance. In addition, task planning mediated the effect of feedback specificity on performance; trust in the feedback predicted an individual's level of performance. The findings are presented as an elaboration of the role of computer-achieved feedback in an organization.},

  abstract = {Item response theory (IRT) is a widely used measurement model. When considering its use in education, health outcomes, and psychology, it is likely to be one of the most impactful psychometric models in existence. IRT has many advantages over classical test theory-based measurement models. For these advantages to hold in practice, strong assumptions must be satisfied. One of these assumptions, local independence, is the focus of the work described here. Local independence is the assumption that, conditional on the latent variable(s), item responses are unrelated to one another (i.e., independent). Stated another way, local independence implies that the only thing causing items to co-vary is the modeled latent variable(s). Violations of this assumption, quite aptly titled local dependence, can have serious consequences for the estimated parameters. A new diagnostic is proposed, based on parameter stability in an item-level jackknife resampling procedure. We review the ideas underlying the new diagnostic and how it is computed before covering some simulated and real examples demonstrating its effectiveness.},

In Exp I, a skilled technician reconstructed circuit diagrams from memory. Recall showed marked "chunking," or grouping, by functional units similar to chess masters' recall of chess positions. In Exp II, skilled Ss were able to recall more than were novice Ss following a brief exposure of the drawings. This advantage did not hold for randomly arranged symbols. In Exp III, the size of chunks retrieved systematically increased with additional study time. Supplementary analyses suggested that the chunking by skilled Ss was not an artifact of spatial proximity and chunk statistics and that severe constraints are placed on any explanation of the data based on guessing. It is proposed that the skilled Ss identified the conceptual category for an entire drawing and retrieved elements using a generate-and-test process.

Given this, a quasi-experimental design was used, specifically non-equivalent pretest-posttest control group design. The study's population comprised six hundred and seventy-three seniors in class one (SS 1) from Igbo-Etiti Local Government Area in Enugu State. The study's participants were a sample of 86 learners selected from two schools purposively. Each school had two SS 1 classes, divided into experimental and control groups via balloting. Data were gathered through the instrumentality of the Mathematics Achievement Test (MAT) and Mathematics Interest Inventory (MII), which have reliability scores of 0.88 and 0.79, respectively. Prior to and following a six-week course of treatment, each group completed a pretest and posttest. SPSS, a statistical tool for social sciences, was applied to analyse the acquired data. The mean and standard deviation were utilised to report the study's questions, and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was utilised to evaluate the hypotheses at a 0.05 significance level. Results established that learners taught mathematics utilising flipped classroom approach had higher mathematics achievement and interest scores than their peers taught using the conventional approach. Results also revealed that the achievement and interest scores of male and female learners who received mathematics instruction using flipped classroom approach were the same. Considering the findings, recommendations were given, among others, that mathematics teachers should use the flipped classroom approach to assist learners in boosting their achievement and interest in mathematics, especially in geometry.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Funnel plots (plots of effect estimates against sample size) may be useful to detect bias in meta-analyses that were later contradicted by large trials. We examined whether a simple test of asymmetry of funnel plots predicts discordance of results when meta-analyses are compared to large trials, and we assessed the prevalence of bias in published meta-analyses. DESIGN: Medline search to identify pairs consisting of a meta-analysis and a single large trial (concordance of results was assumed if effects were in the same direction and the meta-analytic estimate was within 30\% of the trial); analysis of funnel plots from 37 meta-analyses identified from a hand search of four leading general medicine journals 1993-6 and 38 meta-analyses from the second 1996 issue of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Degree of funnel plot asymmetry as measured by the intercept from regression of standard normal deviates against precision. RESULTS: In the eight pairs of meta-analysis and large trial that were identified (five from cardiovascular medicine, one from diabetic medicine, one from geriatric medicine, one from perinatal medicine) there were four concordant and four discordant pairs. In all cases discordance was due to meta-analyses showing larger effects. Funnel plot asymmetry was present in three out of four discordant pairs but in none of concordant pairs. In 14 (38\%) journal meta-analyses and 5 (13\%) Cochrane reviews, funnel plot asymmetry indicated that there was bias. CONCLUSIONS: A simple analysis of funnel plots provides a useful test for the likely presence of bias in meta-analyses, but as the capacity to detect bias will be limited when meta-analyses are based on a limited number of small trials the results from such analyses should be treated with considerable caution.},

In most domains of expertise, individuals begin in their childhood a regimen of effortful activities (deliberate practice) designed to optimize improvement. Individual differences, even among elite performers, are closely related to assessed amounts of deliberate practice. Many characteristics once believed to reflect innate talent are actually the result of intense practice extended for a minimum of 10 yrs. Analysis of expert performance provides unique evidence on the potential and limits of extreme environmental adaptation and learning. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {As a part of a special collection in this issue of Academic Medicine, which is focused on mastery learning in medical education, this Perspective describes how the expert-performance approach with deliberate practice is consistent with many characteristics of mastery learning. Importantly, this Perspective also explains how the expert-performance approach provides a very different perspective on the acquisition of skill. Whereas traditional education with mastery learning focuses on having students attain an adequate level of performance that is based on goals set by the existing curricula, the expert-performance approach takes an empirical approach and first identifies the final goal of training---namely, reproducibly superior objective performance (superior patient outcomes) for individuals in particular medical specialties. Analyzing this superior complex performance reveals three types of mental representations that permit expert performers to plan, execute, and monitor their own performance. By reviewing research on medical performance and education, the author describes evidence for these representations and their development within the expert-performance framework. He uses the research to generate suggestions for improved training of medical students and professionals. Two strategies---designing learning environments with libraries of cases and creating opportunities for individualized teacher-guided training---should enable motivated individuals to acquire a full set of refined mental representations. Providing the right resources to support the expert-performance approach will allow such individuals to become self-regulated learners---that is, members of the medical community who have the tools to improve their own and their team members' performances throughout their entire professional careers.},

  abstract = {Computer programming provides a framework for interdisciplinary learning in sciences, arts and languages. However, increasing integration of programming in K--12 shows that the block-based and text-based dichotomy of programming environments does not reflect the spectrum of their affordance. Hence, educators are confronted with a fundamental hurdle of matching programming environments with learners' cognitive abilities and learning objectives. This study addresses this challenge by analyzing 111 articles evaluating the affordances of programming environments to identify both structural and theoretical models to support educators' choice of programming environments. The following dimensions of programming environments were identified: connectivity mode, interface natural language, language inheritance, age appropriateness, cost of environment, output interface, input interface, and project types. For each of these dimensions, the synthesis of the literature ranged from examining its nature and effect on learning programming to the implications of choosing an environment and the critical gaps that future studies should address. The findings offer instructors useful parameters to compare and assess programming environments' suitability and alignment with learning objectives.},

Predictions stemming from the results of an earlier critical review of the literature (Boud \& Falchikov, 1989) were tested, and salient variables were identified. Factors that seem to be important with regard to the closeness of correspondence between self- and teacher marks were found to include the following: the quality of design of the study (with better designed studies having closer correspondence between student and teacher than poorly designed ones); the level of the course of which the assessment was a part (with students in advanced courses appearing to be more accurate assessors than those in introductory courses); and the broad area of study (with studies within the area of science appearing to produce more accurate self-assessment generally than did those from other areas of study). Results of the analysis are discussed and differences signaled by the results of the three common metrics examined. The distinction between relative and absolute judgment of performance is drawn. It is recommended that researchers give attention to both good design and to adequate reporting of self-assessment studies.},

These principles include (1) inquiry into student learning, (2) grounded in context, (3) methodologically sound, (4) conducted in partnership with students, and (5) appropriately public. Taken together, these five principles can be guideposts for developing and refining individual SoTL inquiries and larger SoTL initiatives.

But the consensus among many in education research is that smaller classes are effective in improving student achievement which has led to a policy of class size reductions in a number of US states, the UK, and the Netherlands. This policy is disputed by those who argue that the effects of class size reduction are only modest and that there are other more cost-effective strategies for improving educational standards. Despite the important policy and practice implications of the topic, the research literature on the educational effects of class-size differences has not been clear.

There is no significant effect on mathematics achievement, though the average is negative meaning a possible adverse impact on some students cannot be ruled out. The overall reading effect corresponds to a 53 per cent chance that a randomly selected score of a student from the treated population of small classes is greater than the score of a randomly selected student from the comparison population of larger classes. This is a very small effect. Class size reduction is costly. The available evidence points to no or only very small effect sizes of small classes in comparison to larger classes. Moreover, we cannot rule out the possibility that small classes may be counterproductive for some students. It is therefore crucial to know more about the relationship between class size and achievement in order to determine where money is best allocated. How up-to-date is this review? The review authors searched for studies published up to February 2017. This Campbell systematic review was published in 2018. Executive Summary/Abstract BACKGROUND Increasing class size is one of the key variables that policy makers can use to control spending on education. Reducing class size to increase student achievement is an approach that has been tried, debated, and analysed for several decades. Despite the important policy and practice implications of the topic, the research literature on the educational effects of class-size differences has not been clear. The consensus among many in education research, that smaller classes are effective in improving student achievement has led to a policy of class size reductions in a number of U.S. states, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands. This policy is disputed by those who argue that the effects of class size reduction are only modest and that there are other more cost-effective strategies for improving educational standards. OBJECTIVES The purpose of this review is to systematically uncover relevant studies in the literature that measure the effects of class size on academic achievement. We will synthesize the effects in a transparent manner and, where possible, we will investigate the extent to which the effects differ among different groups of students such as high/low performers, high/low income families, or members of minority/non-minority groups, and whether timing, intensity, and duration have an impact on the magnitude of the effect. SEARCH METHODS Relevant studies were identified through electronic searches of bibliographic databases, internet search engines and hand searching of core journals. Searches were carried out to February 2017. We searched to identify both published and unpublished literature. The searches were international in scope. Reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews were also searched. SELECTION CRITERIA The intervention of interest was a reduction in class size. We included children in grades kindergarten to 12 (or the equivalent in European countries) in general education. The primary focus was on measures of academic achievement. All study designs that used a well-defined control group were eligible for inclusion. Studies that utilized qualitative approaches were not included. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS The total number of potential relevant studies constituted 8,128 hits. A total of 127 studies, consisting of 148 papers, met the inclusion criteria and were critically appraised by the review authors. The 127 studies analysed 55 different populations from 41 different countries. A large number of studies (45) analysed data from the STAR experiment (class size reduction in grade K-3) and its follow up data. Of the 82 studies not analysing data from the STAR experiment, only six could be used in the data synthesis. Fifty eight studies could not be used in the data synthesis as they were judged to have too high risk of bias either due to confounding (51), other sources of bias (4) or selective reporting of results (3). Eighteen studies did not provide enough information enabling us to calculate an effects size and standard error or did not provide results in a form enabling us to use it in the data synthesis. Meta-analysis was used to examine the effects of class size on student achievement in reading and mathematics. Random effects models were used to pool data across the studies not analysing STAR data. Pooled estimates were weighted using inverse variance methods, and 95\% confidence intervals were estimated. Effect sizes were measured as standardised mean differences (SMD). It was only possible to perform a meta-analysis by the end of the treatment year (end of the school year). Four of the studies analysing STAR data provided effect estimates that could be used in the data synthesis. The four studies differed in terms of both the chosen comparison condition and decision rules in selecting a sample for analysis. Which of these four studies' effect estimates should be included in the data synthesis was not obvious as the decision rule (concerning studies using the same data set) as described in the protocol could not be used. Contrary to usual practice we therefore report the results of all four studies and do not pool the results with the studies not analysing STAR data except in the sensitivity analysis. We took into consideration the ICC in the results reported for the STAR experiment and corrected the effect sizes and standard errors using {$\rho$} = 0.22. No adjustment due to clustering was necessary for the studies not analysing STAR data. Sensitivity analysis was used to evaluate whether the pooled effect sizes were robust across components of methodological quality, in relation to inclusion of a primary study result with an unclear sign, inclusion of effect sizes from the STAR experiment and to using a one-student reduction in class size in studies using class size as a continuous variable. RESULTS All studies, not analysing STAR data, reported outcomes by the end of the treatment (end of the school year) only. The STAR experiment was a four year longitudinal study with outcomes reported by the end of each school year. The experiment was conducted to assess the effectiveness of small classes compared with regular-sized classes and of teachers' aides in regular-sized classes on improving cognitive achievement in kindergarten and in the first, second, and third grades. The goal of the STAR experiment was to have approximately 100 small classes with 13-17 students (S), 100 regular classes with 22-25 students (R), and 100 regular with aide classes with 22-25 students (RA). Of the six studies not analysing STAR, only five were used in the meta-analysis as the direction of the effect size in one study was unclear. The studies were from USA, the Netherlands and France, one was a RCT and five were NRS. The grades investigated spanned kindergarten to 3. Grade and one study investigated grade 10. The sample sizes varied; the smallest study investigated 104 students and the largest study investigated 11,567 students. The class size reductions varied from a minimum of one student in four studies, a minimum of seven students in another study to a minimum of 8 students in the last study. All outcomes were scaled such that a positive effect size favours the students in small classes, i.e. when an effect size is positive a class size reduction improves the students' achievement. Primary study effect sizes for reading lied in the range -0.08 to 0.14. Three of the study-level effects were statistically non-significant. The weighted average was positive and statistically significant. The random effects weighted standardised mean difference was 0.11 (95\% CI 0.05 to 0.16) which may be characterised as small. There is some inconsistency in the direction of the effect sizes between the primary studies. Primary study effect sizes for mathematics lies in the range -0.41 to 0.11. Two of the study-level effects were statistically non-significant. The weighted average was negative and statistically non-significant. The random effects weighted standardised mean difference was -0.03 (95\% CI -0.22 to 0.16). There is some inconsistency in the direction as well as the magnitude of the effect sizes between the primary studies. All reported results from the four studies analysing STAR data indicated a positive effect favouring the treated; all of the study-level effects were statistically significant. The study-level effect sizes for reading varied between 0.17 and 0.34 and the study-level effect sizes for mathematics varied between 0.15 and 0.33. There were no appreciable changes in the results when we included the extremes of the range of effect sizes from the STAR experiment. The reading outcome lost statistical significance when the effect size from the primary study reporting a result with an unclear direction was included with a negative sign and when the results from the studies using class size as a continuous variable were included with a one student reduction in class size instead of a standard deviation reduction in class size. Otherwise, there were no appreciable changes in the results. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS There is some evidence to suggest that there is an effect of reducing class size on reading achievement, although the effect is very small. We found a statistically significant positive effect of reducing the class size on reading. The effect on mathematics achievement was not statistically significant, thus it is uncertain if there may be a negative effect. The overall reading effect corresponds to a 53 per cent chance that a randomly selected score of a student from the treated population of small classes is greater than the score of a randomly selected student from the comparison population of larger classes. The overall effect on mathematics achievement corresponds to a 49 per cent chance that a randomly selected score of a student from the treated population of small classes is greater than the score of a randomly selected student from the comparison population of larger classes. Class size reduction is costly and the available evidence points to no or only very small effect sizes of small classes in comparison to larger classes. Taking the individual variation in effects into consideration, we cannot rule out the possibility that small classes may be counterproductive for some students. It is therefore crucial to know more about the relationship between class size and achievement and how it influences what teachers and students do in the classroom in order to determine where money is best allocated.},

Comparisons between interdisciplinary research and other forms of cross-disciplinary research are made, and a brief discussion of the development of the concept of interdisciplinarity is provided. The overarching thesis of this essay is that interdisciplinary research is team research, that is, research conducted by a team. This notion is developed via recent policy discussions of team science and the need to understand interdisciplinary research in action. The author shows how it may be possible to consider the implementation of principles from teamwork and team training to improve interdisciplinary research and the practice of team science.},

Previous research has shown that people generally have difficulty distinguishing AI-generated from human-written texts; however, the ability of teachers to identify an AI-generated text among student essays has not yet been investigated. Here we show in two experimental studies that novice (N~=~89) and experienced teachers (N~=~200) could not identify texts generated by ChatGPT among student-written texts. However, there are some indications that more experienced teachers made more differentiated and more accurate judgments. Furthermore, both groups were overconfident in their judgments. Effects of real and assumed source on quality assessment were heterogeneous. Our findings demonstrate that with relatively little prompting, current AI can generate texts that are not detectable for teachers, which poses a challenge to schools and universities in grading student essays. Our study provides empirical evidence for the current debate regarding exam strategies in schools and universities in light of the latest technological developments.},

  abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) is already having a major impact on society. As a result, many organizations have launched a wide range of initiatives to establish ethical principles for the adoption of socially beneficial AI. Unfortunately, the sheer volume of proposed principles threatens to overwhelm and confuse. How might this problem of `principle proliferation' be solved? In this paper, we report the results of a fine-grained analysis of several of the highest-profile sets of ethical principles for AI. We assess whether these principles converge upon a set of agreed-upon principles, or diverge, with significant disagreement over what constitutes `ethical AI.' Our analysis finds a high degree of overlap among the sets of principles we analyze. We then identify an overarching framework consisting of five core principles for ethical AI. Four of them are core principles commonly used in bioethics: beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy, and justice. On the basis of our comparative analysis, we argue that a new principle is needed in addition: explicability, understood as incorporating both the epistemological sense of intelligibility (as an answer to the question `how does it work?') and in the ethical sense of accountability (as an answer to the question: `who is responsible for the way it works?'). In the ensuing discussion, we note the limitations and assess the implications of this ethical framework for future efforts to create laws, rules, technical standards, and best practices for ethical AI in a wide range of contexts.},

  abstract = {Large lectures are commonly characterized by lacking interactivity and adaptability to individual learning processes. Flipped classroom as a more active learning design has the potential to meet this challenge. For knowledge acquisition in flipped classrooms, students' regular and timely engagement in watching pre-class videos on new topics is critical to benefit from the learning activities in the in-class sessions. However, there is limited evidence on the relationship between engagement in pre-class video watching and later achievement and particularly in knowledge retention in flipped classroom. Thus, we developed sophisticated pre-class learning videos for a large statistics lecture and set up a flipped course design. We regressed course achievement on students' timing of watching the pre-class videos. To contrast the relation between preclass video watching and other typically discussed predictors of achievement, we controlled for prior achievement and motivation. We found that students, who watch the videos before the corresponding in-class session perform better, both in the short-term (final exam) and in the long-term (follow-up-test four months later). Our results suggest that timing rather than quantity of video watching matters in terms of academic performance and knowledge retention. The findings highlight the important role of motivational interventions aiming at encouraging students to prepare for class in time to ensure knowledge acquisition in flipped classrooms.},

Because TESS proposals undergo rigorous peer review, the studies in the sample all exceed a substantial quality threshold. Strong results are 40 percentage points more likely to be published than are null results and 60 percentage points more likely to be written up. We provide direct evidence of publication bias and identify the stage of research production at which publication bias occurs: Authors do not write up and submit null findings.},

Negotiations between DEAL and Elsevier began in 2016, and broke down without a successful agreement in 2018; in this time, around 200 German research institutions cancelled their license agreements with Elsevier, leading Elsevier to restrict journal access at those institutions. We investigated the effect on researchers' publishing and citing behaviours from a bibliometric perspective, using a dataset of {\textasciitilde}400,000 articles published by researchers at DEAL institutions between 2012-2020. We further investigated these effects with respect to the timing of contract cancellations, research disciplines, collaboration patterns, and article open-access status. We find evidence for a decrease in Elsevier's market share of articles from DEAL institutions, with the largest year-on-year market share decreases occurring from 2018 to 2020 following the implementation of access restrictions. We also observe year-on-year decreases in the proportion of citations, although the decrease is smaller. We conclude that negotiations with Elsevier and access restrictions have led to some reduced willingness to publish in Elsevier journals, but that researchers are not strongly affected in their ability to cite Elsevier articles, implying that researchers use other methods to access scientific literature.},

This research paper outlines a feedback model as an extension of the four-dimensional framework which includes a consideration of the type, the content, the format, and the frequency of feedback, as well as the agent which delivers it. This model is based upon an understanding of learning in the context of designing learning experiences and utilises a game-based model of learning to understand the importance of motivation and autonomy in learners to enhance and accelerate learning. The framework is developed and reflected upon by analysing two cases: a medical triage case in which the timing and frequency of feedback proved critical, and a business simulation which illuminated the need for a range of types of feedback and to be aware of the possibility of different agents (instructor peer and game) that can deliver feedback. The extended model may help game and learning designers alike to discern different types of feedback, both in games and more generally, in more explicit and nuanced ways.},

Nonetheless, the effectiveness of this methodology is still being discussed. In this sense, the aim of this study is to analyse whether flipped classroom methodology is a more effective methodology than other methodologies. For this purpose, a systematic review was carried out, considering as valid studies those that had a pre-post and a control group. Based on a total of 61 studies (n = 5541 students) from 18 databases, results revealed that Flipped Classroom methodology is more effective than other methodologies in terms of learning achievement, in secondary and higher education, and it could be more beneficial than other methodologies in other constructs as motivation, self-efficacy, cooperativeness and engagement, among others. In primary education, findings revealed that Flipped Classroom could be as effective as other methodologies with regard to learning achievement, and other construct, such as self-concept and social climate. Depending on the educational stage, the effect size of differences was between 1.36 to 1.80 times larger in the case of Flipped Classroom group in comparison with control group. Based on these results, the Flipped Classroom could be more beneficial in comparison with traditional methodologies that are mainly used in higher education. However, it would not more beneficial in other educational stages where traditional approaches are not commonly used, such as in primary education.},

This is also true for approaches of contextual learning. In this contribution, characteristic features of contextual learning approaches will be described. In addition, the most important research surveys and their designs will be discussed. Following the first predominantly ethno-methodological phase, current research focuses on the investigation of the collaborative culture of learning, analyzing both shared and individual knowledge. At this stage, research is mainly based on the principle of ecological validity, implemented by means of complex designs and field experiments. The presented surveys of five research groups show a change in methodology that is called interactive or integrative methodology. Finally, this contribution refers to possible consequences for educational philosophy and technology. (DIPF/Orig.)},

  abstract = {The ``replication crisis'' has been attributed to misguided external incentives gamed by researchers (the strategic-game hypothesis). Here, I want to draw attention to a complementary internal factor, namely, researchers' widespread faith in a statistical ritual and associated delusions (the statistical-ritual hypothesis). The ``null ritual,'' unknown in statistics proper, eliminates judgment precisely at points where statistical theories demand it. The crucial delusion is that the p value specifies the probability of a successful replication (i.e., 1 -- p), which makes replication studies appear to be superfluous. A review of studies with 839 academic psychologists and 991 students shows that the replication delusion existed among 20\% of the faculty teaching statistics in psychology, 39\% of the professors and lecturers, and 66\% of the students. Two further beliefs, the illusion of certainty (e.g., that statistical significance proves that an effect exists) and Bayesian wishful thinking (e.g., that the probability of the alternative hypothesis being true is 1 -- p), also make successful replication appear to be certain or almost certain, respectively. In every study reviewed, the majority of researchers (56\%--97\%) exhibited one or more of these delusions. Psychology departments need to begin teaching statistical thinking, not rituals, and journal editors should no longer accept manuscripts that report results as ``significant'' or ``not significant.''},

Experimental and observational studies were included and obtained through searches of PubMed, Education Resources Information Center (ERIC), and Google Scholar. Publications from January 1, 2000 through July 1, 2017 were included. Studies were eligible for this research if: (a) the study compared student outcomes using flipped classroom versus lecture and (b) at least one outcome measure was final examination score or final course score. This analysis used a random effects model with weighted mean difference (WMD) as the outcome., Results. Six studies were included in the qualitative synthesis and five were included in the quantitative synthesis. To date, there has only been one prospective randomized comparison of flipped classroom to lecture in student pharmacist education. When comparing final examination scores, there was no significant difference between flipped classroom and lecture based instruction. Only two studies examined the effect of flipped classroom compared to lecture on final course score. This analysis also found no significant difference., Conclusion. Despite a lack of prospective randomized studies, findings from this meta-analysis suggest that flipped classroom may be associated with minimal gains in student knowledge compared to lecture. These findings are important because previous research has estimated that the flipped classroom requires more time to develop and implement. Future studies using prospective randomized designs need to be conducted before widespread adoption.},

Beliefs were differentiated into beliefs on transmissive learning and beliefs of constructivist learning with three subdomains of discovery learning, social learning and reality-based learning. Contrary to theoretical expectations, the constructivist and transmissive beliefs do not form opposites but align with each other. Beliefs on discovery and transmissive learning techniques are highly correlated and are positive predictors of mathematical achievement, while beliefs on social learning and reality-based learning are negative predictors. These findings are more pronounced for female students than for male students and increase with higher school levels. Similar to implicit theories on intelligence, the effects of mathematics instruction that is perceived by students as cognitively activating on mathematical achievement are completely mediated by their beliefs toward mathematics learning. It was found that beliefs on discovery and transmissive learning serve as positive mediators, beliefs on reality-based learning as negative mediator.},

Addressing this challenge, this study introduces COA-GPT, a novel algorithm employing Large Language Models (LLMs) for rapid and efficient generation of valid COAs. COA-GPT incorporates military doctrine and domain expertise to LLMs through in-context learning, allowing commanders to input mission information - in both text and image formats - and receive strategically aligned COAs for review and approval. Uniquely, COA-GPT not only accelerates COA development, producing initial COAs within seconds, but also facilitates real-time refinement based on commander feedback. This work evaluates COA-GPT in a military-relevant scenario within a militarized version of the StarCraft II game, comparing its performance against state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms. Our results demonstrate COA-GPT's superiority in generating strategically sound COAs more swiftly, with added benefits of enhanced adaptability and alignment with commander intentions. COA-GPT's capability to rapidly adapt and update COAs during missions presents a transformative potential for military planning, particularly in addressing planning discrepancies and capitalizing on emergent windows of opportunities.},

AI-based tools have become particularly common in assessment decisions, such as when recruiting employees or admitting students. Calls for transparency and new legislation require organizations to disclose the use of AI assessment tools, thus making people under assessment aware of its use. We investigate whether this shift from human to AI assessment affects people's behavior during the assessment. We propose that people emphasize their analytical characteristics and downplay their intuitive and emotional ones under AI (vs. human) assessment, a phenomenon we label ``the AI assessment effect.'' Twelve studies (eight in text and four in the Supporting Information;               N               = 13,342) document the AI assessment effect and its underlying mechanism: the lay belief that AI prioritizes analytical characteristics in its assessment. Whereas prior work has studied perceptions of AI assessment tools and their productivity gains, the current research demonstrates systematic behavioral changes because of AI assessment. The findings offer theoretical contributions to the psychology of AI and practical insights for organizations using AI assessment.},

  abstract = {A respectable amount of work dealing with Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) clearly indicates a popularity of TAM in the field of technology acceptance in general. Nevertheless, there is still a gap in existing knowledge regarding representative academic literature that underlie research on TAM in educational context. The main objective of this systematic literature review is to provide an overview of the current state of research efforts on TAM application in the field of learning and teaching for a variety of learning domains, learning technologies and types of users. Through systematic search by the use of EBSCO Discovery Service, the review has identified 71 relevant studies ranged between 2003 and 2018. The main findings indicate that TAM and its many different versions represent a credible model for facilitating assessment of diverse learning technologies. TAM's core variables, perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness, have been proven to be antecedent factors affecting acceptance of learning with technology. The paper identifies some gaps in current work and suggests areas for further investigation. The results of this systematic review provide a better understanding of TAM acceptance studies in educational context and create a firm foundation for advancing knowledge in the field. Practitioner Notes What is already known about this topic Technology acceptance research in teaching and learning context has become an attractive trend. A number of reviews and meta-analysis focused on specific topics related to technology acceptance in education have been conducted. The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) is the key model in understanding predictors of human behaviour towards potential acceptance or rejection of the technology. What this paper adds The state of current research on Technology Acceptance Model application in educational context lacks comprehensive reviews addressing variety of learning domains, learning technologies and types of users. The paper presents systematic review of relevant academic literature on Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) in the field of learning and teaching. The paper provides empirical evidence on the predictive validity of the models based on TAM presented in selected literature. The findings revealed that TAM, along with its many different versions called TAM++, is a leading scientific paradigm and credible model for facilitating assessment of diverse technological deployments in educational context. TAM's core variables, perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness, have been proven to be antecedent factors that have affected acceptance of learning with technology. Implications for practice and/or policy The systematic review adds to the body of knowledge and creates a firm foundation for advancing knowledge in the field. By following the most common research objectives and/or by filling current gaps in applied research methods, chosen sample groups and types of result analysis, an own study could be conducted. Future research may well focus on identifying additional external factors that could further explain acceptance and usage of various learning technologies.},

The aim of this study is to calculate the common effect size of empirical studies conducted out between 2017-2022 that investigated the effect of self-regulated learning strategies on learning outcomes in online and blended environments, and to determine whether the common effect size shows a significant difference in terms of course type, self-regulated learning strategy type, school level, and learning context. A meta-analytical review method was employed to combine the outcome of independent empirical studies. The studies included in this review were collected from Scopus, IEEE Explore, and ERIC databases.~ A total of 15 studies included in this study. Cohen's d coefficient was calculated for the effect size in this study. As the heterogeneity among the effect sizes of the studies was high (Q {$>$} {$\chi$}2, p {$<$} .05), the common effect size was calculated in accordance with the random effects model. As a result of the meta-analysis, it was determined that self-regulated learning strategies had a ``moderate'' effect (Q= 0.65) on learning outcomes in online and blended environments. Moreover, the calculated common effect size showed no significant difference according to the type of self-regulated learning strategy, course type, school level, and learning context.},

  abstract = {Background Homework is a common educational task given to students around the world. It demands mental exertion, but staying focused can be challenging, especially for K-12 students. Too much homework can increase their cognitive load and mental fatigue, leading to decreased motivation and performance. This can cause boredom with homework and learning. To lessen their load and make homework more effective, it is important to establish the connection between homework duration and academic achievement. Objectives To evaluate the relationship between homework time and academic performance among K-12 students. Search Methods On November 5, 2021, we retrieved articles from a variety sources. Firstly, we searched 10 electronic databases for related publications, including Academic Search Premier, APA PsycArticles, APA PsycInfo, Business Source Premier, Education Resources Information Center (ERIC), Journal Storage (JSTOR), Learning and Technology Library (LearnTechLib), OCLC FirstSearch, Social Sciences Citation Index (Web of Science), and Teacher Reference Center. We also searched two publisher platforms: ScienceDirect and Taylor \& Francis Online Database. Secondly, we consulted five educational organization website such as, American Educational Research Association, Best Evidence Encyclopedia, Education Endowment Foundation, European Educational Research Association, What Works Clearinghouse, and the Open Grey database for unpublished studies. We then searched Open Dissertations and ProQuest Dissertations \& Theses Global databases to locate the relevant dissertations and theses. Additionally, we hand-searched seven educational journals to identify unpublished documents, reports, and potential studies not indexed in the databases. Lastly, we searched Campbell Library to identify relevant reviews and primary (and nearly eligible studies) in these reviews. We also searched Google Scholar for related studies and checked the citations of eligible studies as well as their bibliographies. Selection Criteria Studies with the following criteria were included: - Population: K-12 school students with no disabilities or not attending special education schools; - Intervention: Homework assigned regularly by schoolteachers to students to complete during non-school hours; - Comparison: Different time spent on the homework; - Outcomes: Academic performance was the primary outcome. The secondary outcomes were academic motivation and the quality of homework; - Study design: Treatment-control group design or comparison group design studies. Data Collection and Analysis We reviewed the titles, abstracts, and full texts of the retrieved records. Our team extracted and coded all relevant information from the studies that met our inclusion criteria. To evaluate the risk of bias, we used the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for randomized controlled trials and ROBINS-I for non-randomized controlled trials. A random-effect meta-analysis was conducted to determine the effect of homework on academic achievement as compared to no homework. A funnel plot, trim-and-fill method and Egger's test were used to test for any publication bias. Due to the insufficient data on homework duration and academic achievement, we analyzed these data using qualitative synthesis. Main Results Eleven publications were identified that examined the relationship between homework duration and academic outcomes using an experimental design. Based on their focus, we categorized them into two groups: comparisons of homework with no homework and comparison of homework with less homework. There were 10 articles with 14 independent reports that compared academic performance between students who did homework and those who did not. Overall, the meta-analysis revealed that the students who did homework had better academic performance than that those who did not (n = 14; g = 0.45, 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.24--0.66; Q = 454.30, I2 = 71.30\%, {$\tau$}2 = 0.11), especially in arithmetic computation (n = 5; g = 0.46, 95\% CI: 0.17--0.75; Q = 13.03, I2 = 69.29\%, {$\tau$}2 = 0.07) and arithmetic problems solving (n = 6; g = 0.17, 95\% CI: 0.02--0.33; Q = 6.87, I2 = 27.17\%, {$\tau$}2 = 0.01), but not in arithmetic concepts (n = 3, g = -0.02, 95\% CI: -0.22--0.18; Q = 1.46, I2 = 0.00\%, {$\tau$}2 = 0.00). Two experiments explored the effectiveness of homework moderated by homework time. In Koch (1965), the effects of long daily homework (20--30 min) and short daily homework (10--15 min) were compared. The authors found that achievement in arithmetic concepts was higher with long homework assignments every day. Recently, Dolean and Lervag (2021) confirmed the effect of homework on writing skills, and their findings were consistent with those of Koch (1965), who found that increasing time spent on homework was associated with greater writing achievement (average 20 min each time). Authors' Conclusions Homework could be used as a supplement to enhance the academic performance of primary school students. However, the optimal amount of time they should dedicate each day to homework to achieve the best results remains uncertain. More high-quality experiments are needed to determine the ideal homework duration for these students. Furthermore, additional research is required to understand the impact of homework on secondary school students.},

This research indicated that such abstracts are more informative, more readable, and more appreciated by readers than are traditional abstracts. Aim. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that structured abstracts might also be appropriate for a particular psychology journal. Method. Twenty-four traditional abstracts from the Journal of Educational Psychology were rewritten in a structured form. Measures of word length, information content, and readability were made for both sets of abstracts, and forty-eight authors rated their clarity. Results. The structured abstracts were significantly longer than the original ones, but they were also significantly more informative and readable and judged significantly clearer by these academic authors. Conclusions. These findings support the notion that structured abstracts could be profitably introduced into psychology journals.},

However, the examples of failure used in these studies did not display the problem-solving-and-failing process, which may have limited the preparatory effects. In this quasi-experiment, we investigated whether observing someone else engaging in problem solving can prepare students for instruction, and whether examples that show the problem-solving-and -failing process are more effective than those that only show the outcome of this process. We also explored whether the perceived model--observer similarity had an impact on the effectiveness of observing examples of failure. The results showed that observing examples effectively prepares students for learning from instruction. However, observing the model's problem-solving-and-failing process did not prepare students more effectively than merely looking at the outcome. Studying examples were more effective if model--observer similarity was high.},

Yet, research on PF shows that students who are involved in problem solving prior to instruction gain more conceptual knowledge from the subsequent instruction compared to students who receive the instruction first. So far, there is no conclusive evidence, however, that the beneficial effects of PF are explained by the attempt to generate one's own solutions prior to instruction. The literature on example-based learning suggests that observing someone else engaging in problem-solving attempts may be an equally effective means to prepare students for instruction. In an experimental study, we compared a PF condition, in which students were actively engaged in problem solving prior to instruction, to two example conditions, in which students either observed the complete problem-solving-and-failing process of another student engaging in PF or looked at the outcome of this process (i.e., another student's failed solution attempts). Rather than worked examples of the correct solution procedure, the students observed examples of failed solution attempts. We found that students' own problem solving was not superior to the two example conditions. In fact, students who observed the complete PF process even outperformed students who engaged in PF themselves. Additional analyses revealed that the students' prior knowledge moderated this effect: While students who observed the complete PF process were able to take advantage of their prior knowledge to gain more conceptual knowledge from the subsequent instruction, prior knowledge did not affect students' post-test performance in the PF condition.},

The Productive Failure approach has been found to be more supportive for conceptual knowledge acquisition during subsequent instruction compared to a direct-instruction condition in which students receive instruction first followed by problem solving. Failing at problem-solving attempts prior to instruction is considered to prepare students to better understand the concepts underlying the problem. However, it is an open question whether students need to fail themselves to be effectively prepared for subsequent instruction. We therefore compared the effectiveness of two alternative preparatory activities: Students either engaged in problem-solving attempts themselves or were shown problem-solving attempts of another student. This experimental variation allows to show the necessity of own failure for the effectiveness of the PF approach.

Its power is frequently mentioned in articles about learning and teaching, but surprisingly few recent studies have systematically investigated its meaning. This article provides a conceptual analysis of feedback and reviews the evidence related to its impact on learning and achievement. This evidence shows that although feedback is among the major influences, the type of feedback and the way it is given can be differentially effective. A model of feedback is then proposed that identifies the particular properties and circumstances that make it effective, and some typically thorny issues are discussed, including the timing of feedback and the effects of positive and negative feedback. Finally, this analysis is used to suggest ways in which feedback can be used to enhance its effectiveness in classrooms.},

Across two classroom experiments, undergraduates learned about noncovalent interactions in biochemistry by either receiving explicit instruction before problem-solving (I-PS group) or engaging in problem-solving before explicit instruction (PS-I group). Then all students completed near- and far-transfer tests on the material. In Experiment 1, participants were introductory biology students (\$\$n={\textbackslash},367\$\$), who had relatively low prior knowledge of the topic. Results indicated that the PS-I group significantly outperformed the I-PS group on the near-transfer test, providing support for productive failure. In Experiment 2, participants were biochemistry students (\$\$n=138\$\$), who had relatively higher prior knowledge of the topic. In contrast to Experiment 1, results indicated that the I-PS group significantly outperformed the PS-I group, providing support for cognitive load theory. Neither experiment showed significant effects of instructional sequences on the far-transfer test. Overall, the findings suggest the effects of instructional sequences on students with different levels of topic-specific prior knowledge may not be as straightforward as existing theories suggest.},

  abstract = {Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a significant and growing public health concern. Investigating alterations in speech and language patterns offers a promising path towards cost-effective and non-invasive early detection of AD on a large scale. Large language models (LLMs), such as GPT, have enabled powerful new possibilities for semantic text analysis. In this study, we leverage GPT-4 to extract five semantic features from transcripts of spontaneous patient speech. The features capture known symptoms of AD, but they are difficult to quantify effectively using traditional methods of computational linguistics. We demonstrate the clinical significance of these features and further validate one of them ("Word-Finding Difficulties") against a proxy measure and human raters. When combined with established linguistic features and a Random Forest classifier, the GPT-derived features significantly improve the detection of AD. Our approach proves effective for both manually transcribed and automatically generated transcripts, representing a novel and impactful use of recent advancements in LLMs for AD speech analysis.},

However, it is not clear if including the instructor on-screen in an instructional video provides any benefit to learners, and the research in the area has not been synthesized. We conducted a systematic review to examine the impact of an on-screen instructor on learning and affect. Twelve studies met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed. Our analysis of the results showed no consistent, compelling evidence that an instructor should be included on-screen in instructional videos, as non-significant and mixed results were pervasive throughout the literature. However, we also did not find convincing evidence to leave an instructor out of the instructional video, as some studies found that learners were more satisfied when the instructor was visually-present. We explore these results in more depth, highlight the need for more studies in the area, and outline potentially productive frameworks for systematic lines of research.},

These measures should be adaptable to the unique challenges to studying technology-mediated learning, such as when students learn at a distance or in a blended learning course. In this review, we examine existing approaches to measure engagement in technology-mediated learning.

  abstract = {The use of meta-analyses has become increasingly widespread in flipped classroom research. They are typically seen as a more objective and credible method of summarizing the effects of the flipped classroom approach. However, problems among meta-analyses are long-standing and widespread, and can undermine the credibility of the results. This paper has two major objectives: (a) to examine the methodological features of the meta-analyses, and (b) to discuss the key methodological concerns of the meta-analyses. Nineteen flipped classroom meta-analyses were analyzed in this study, which included more than 495 unique primary studies, involving more than 72,200 flipped and 77,100 non-flipped participants. Given that at least 19 meta-analyses of the flipped classroom approach have been conducted so far, a critical appraisal of these meta-analyses is both important and timely because it will allow practitioners to evaluate the trustworthiness of the findings. The results of these meta-analyses suggest the mean effect sizes for cognitive outcomes (0.19--1.13), behavioral outcomes (1.40--3.12), and perceptual outcomes (0.05--1.62) vary from weak to strong support of flipped learning. However, some key methodological elements -- searching for reference lists and grey literature, assessing the risk of bias in primary studies, non-independence of effect sizes, control for student initial differences, control for instructor equivalence, and assessing publication bias -- were inadequately conducted or reported in the flipped classroom meta-analyses. There is positive empirical evidence for the flipped classroom, but there is also reason to question how this evidence has been synthesized.},

  abstract = {Selbst{\"a}ndige Wissensaneignung und Lernorganisation sind Schl{\"u}sselqualifikationen der Informationsgesellschaft. Die Mixed-Methods-Studie untersucht interindividuelle Unterschiede bei Sch{\"u}lerinnen und Sch{\"u}lern im Umgang mit dem selbst organisierten Lernen am Gymnasium. Es werden vier Lernertypen identifiziert, die durch eine inhaltsanalytische Auswertung von Interviews und zwei Fallbeispiele genauer charakterisiert werden. Aus den Ergebnissen werden Empfehlungen f{\"u}r die Gestaltung selbst organisierter Lerneinheiten abgeleitet. Selbst organisiertes Lernen setzt voraus, dass Lernende zu aktiven Gestaltern ihres eigenen Lernprozesses werden. Die vorliegende Studie geht davon aus, dass nicht alle Sch{\"u}lerinnen und Sch{\"u}ler mit der ihnen zugemuteten Autonomie beim selbst organisierten Lernen konstruktiv umzugehen wissen, da sie sich sowohl hinsichtlich der notwendigen F{\"a}higkeiten zur Selbstregulation des Lernens (Lernstrategien, Metakognition) als auch bez{\"u}glich der motivationalen Voraussetzungen zum Lernen unterscheiden. Gegenstand der Untersuchung sind daher interindividuelle Differenzen beim selbst organisierten Lernen bei Sch{\"u}lerinnen und Sch{\"u}lern, die methodisch in einem sequentiellen Mixed-Methods-Ansatz untersucht werden. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass sich die vier Lernertypen deutlich voneinander unterscheiden, wenn auch nicht in allen untersuchten Aspekten. Bedeutende Erkl{\"a}rungskraft wird einer besonderen Vorstellung von Lernen zugeschrieben, die sich verst{\"a}rkt beim Typ der erfolgreichen Lernenden zeigt: Personen dieses Typs betrachten Lernen als Herausforderung und Chance f{\"u}r die pers{\"o}nliche Weiterentwicklung, akzeptieren, dass Lerngelegenheiten aus Ungewissheit beinhalten und betonen gleichzeitig, dass f{\"u}r erfolgreiches Lernen Persistenz notwendig ist.

Overall, digital tool use had a positive effect on student learning outcomes (g~=~0.65, p~{$<~$}.001). The provision of teacher trainings on digital tool use significantly moderated the overall effect. Use of intelligent tutoring systems or simulations such as dynamic mathematical tools was significantly more beneficial than hypermedia systems. On a descriptive level, the effect size was larger when digital tools were used in addition to other instruction methods and not as a substitute. The results open up new directions for future research and can inform evidence-based decision-making on the use of digital tools in education.},

  abstract = {The value of a non-pecuniary (free) product is inherently difficult to assess. A pervasive example is open source software (OSS), a global public good that plays a vital role in the economy and is foundational for most technology we use today. However, it is difficult to measure the value of OSS due to its non-pecuniary nature and lack of centralized usage tracking. Therefore, OSS remains largely unaccounted for in economic measures. Although prior studies have estimated the supply side costs to recreate this software, a lack of data has hampered estimating the much larger demand-side (usage) value created by OSS. Therefore, to understand the complete economic and social value of widely-used OSS, we leverage unique global data from two complementary sources capturing OSS usage by millions of global firms. We first estimate the supply-side value by calculating the cost to recreate the most widely used OSS once. We then calculate the demand side value based on a replacement value for each firm that uses the software and would need to build it internally if OSS did not exist. We estimate the supply-side value of widely-used OSS is \$4.15 billion, but that the demand-side value is much larger at \$8.8 trillion. We find that firms would need to spend 3.5 times more on software than they currently do if OSS did not exist. The top six programming languages in our sample comprise 84\% of the demand-side value of OSS. Further, 96\% of the demand-side value is created by only 5\% of OSS developers.},

  abstract = {During the lockdown due to SARS-CoV-2 (coronavirus lockdown), there has been a tremendous increase in the number of students taking online courses. Few studies, however, have examined the individual dispositions that influence self-regulated online learning during the coronavirus lockdown. To address this gap, the present study explored the ineffectiveness of online learning and examined how it can be predicted by self-regulated online learning and participants' procrastination disposition. Data of 433 participants were collected and subjected to confirmatory factor analysis with structural equation modeling. The results indicated that procrastination is negatively related to 6 sub-constructs of self-regulated online learning: task strategy, mood adjustment, self-evaluation, environmental structure, time management, and help-seeking. These sub-constructs were negatively related to the learners' perceived ineffectiveness of online learning. However, the relationship between perceived learning ineffectiveness and environmental structure or help-seeking was weaker than that with task strategy or mood adjustment, indicating that the latter two subtypes of self-regulated online learning should be considered before students engage in online learning.},

  abstract = {Student outcomes are influenced by different types of motivation that stem from external incentives, ego involvement, personal value, and intrinsic interest. The types of motivation described in self-determination theory each co-occur to different degrees and should lead to different consequences. The associations with outcomes are due in part to unique characteristics and in part to the degree of autonomy each entails. In the current meta-analysis, we examine these different types of motivation in 344 samples (223,209 participants) as they relate to 26 performance, well-being, goal orientation, and persistence-related student outcomes. Findings highlight that intrinsic motivation is related to student success and well-being, whereas personal value (identified regulation) is particularly highly related to persistence. Ego-involved motives (introjected regulation) were positively related to persistence and performance goals but also positively related with indicators of ill-being. Motivation driven by a desire to obtain rewards or avoid punishment (external regulation) was not associated with performance or persistence but was associated with decreased wellbeing. Finally, amotivation was related to poor outcomes. Relative weights analysis further estimates the degree to which motivation types uniquely predict outcomes, highlighting that identified regulation and intrinsic motivation are likely key factors for school adjustment.},

To help researchers harness the promise of LLMs, this tutorial offers a primer on the open-source Hugging Face ecosystem and demonstrates several applications that advance conceptual and empirical work in behavioral science, including feature extraction, fine-tuning of models for prediction, and generation of behavioral responses. Executable code is made available at github.com/Zak-Hussain/LLM4BeSci.git. Finally, the tutorial discusses challenges faced by research with (open-source) LLMs related to interpretability and safety and offers a perspective on future research at the intersection of language modeling and behavioral science.},

This article argues that, while learning outcomes can be valuable if properly used, they have been misappropriated and adopted widely at all levels within the education system to facilitate the managerial process. This has led to their distortion. The claim that they can be made precise by being written with a prescribed vocabulary of special descriptors so as to serve as objective, measurable devices for monitoring performance, is fundamentally mistaken, and they may be damaging to education when used in this way. After a brief sketch of the background to the notion of learning outcomes, arguments are presented to show their vacuity and uselessness when misused in this way, and explanations of their inadequacies are offered.},

  abstract = {This paper employs a comparison between two forms of online instruction to investigate which form is more preferred, as well as the advantages and the disadvantages for both forms of online education. The data for the research were collected via an online questionnaire that was purposely created for the research. A sample of 26 undergraduate students of Yonsei University, South Korea, were employed for this study. Pre-tests and post-tests were performed to compare between pre-recorded video lectures and live ZOOM lectures. The results show that students prefer pre-recorded video lectures to live ZOOM lectures; 53.8\% chose pre-recorded video lectures, 7.7\% chose live ZOOM lectures, and 30.8\% chose both pre-recorded and ZOOM lectures when they were asked to select their preferred method of learning. Furthermore, we asked several questions, and the mean values were compared. The results of this research showed that pre-recorded video lectures are preferred to live ZOOM lectures due to their flexibility, convenience, and educational effectiveness. However, learning through video lectures depends on students' motivation to get through those materials on their own. Lack of motivation and clear deadlines to watch those video lecture materials could end up in an accumulation of workload, which would be difficult to overcome before examinations.},

Therefore, this study addresses the following questions: What prompts are needed to ensure high-quality LLM feedback in HE? How does feedback from novices, experts, and LLMs differ in terms of quality and content accuracy? We developed a learning goal with three errors and a theory-based manual to evaluate prompt quality. Specifically, three prompts of varying quality were created and used to generate feedback from ChatGPT-4. We provided the highest-quality prompt to novices and experts. Our results showed that only the best prompt produced consistently high-quality feedback. Additionally, LLM and expert feedback were significantly better than novice feedback, with LLM feedback being both faster and better than expert feedback in the categories of explanation, questions, and specificity. This suggests that LLM feedback can be a high-quality and efficient alternative to expert feedback. However, we postulate that prompt quality is crucial, highlighting the need for prompting guidelines and human expertise.},

Feedback generated by large language models (LLMs) has shown potential for enhancing student learning outcomes. However, few empirical studies have directly compared the quality of LLM feedback with feedback from novices and experts. This study investigates (1) the types of prompts needed to ensure high-quality LLM feedback in teacher education and (2) how feedback from novices, experts, and LLMs compares in terms of quality. Methods: To address these questions, we developed a theory-driven manual to evaluate prompt quality and designed three prompts of varying quality. Feedback generated by ChatGPT-4 was assessed alongside feedback from novices and experts, who were provided with the highest-quality prompt. Results: Our findings reveal that only the best prompt consistently produced high-quality feedback. Additionally, LLM feedback outperformed novice feedback and, in the categories explanation, questions, and specificity, even surpassed expert feedback in quality while being generated more quickly. Conclusions: These results suggest that LLMs, when guided by well-crafted prompts, can serve as high-quality and efficient alternatives to expert feedback. The findings underscore the importance of prompt quality and emphasize the need for prompt design guidelines to maximize the potential of LLMs in teacher education.},

By employing a comprehensive framework that includes perceived risk, perceived ease of use, usefulness, Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK), and trust, the study aims to reveal the crucial roles that these factors play in shaping the intention to embrace Gen-AI. Through the utilization of a hybrid approach that combines Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), the research examines the complex relationships among these predictors and their overall impact on the adoption of Gen-AI. By examining a diverse cohort of 242 participants, including undergraduate and postgraduate students, as well as faculty members from Indian Higher Education Institutions, the research uncovers significant determinants such as perceived ease of use, usefulness, TPACK, and trust. Interestingly, perceived usefulness does not emerge as a significant factor in influencing the intention to adopt AI in Higher Education. Through demographic analysis using the SPSS statistical tool package, the study reveals non-compensatory and nonlinear relationships between age, gender, and the intention to use AI. By leveraging the significant predictors identified through SEM, the developed ANN model accurately predicts the intention to use AI with a 71\% accuracy rate. This study not only provides valuable insights into the theoretical foundations but also offers practical implications for the seamless integration of Gen-AI in higher education.},

  abstract = {Writing is fundamental in knowledge-based societies, and engaging students in text revision through feedback is critical for developing students' writing skills. Automated feedback offers a promising solution to teachers' time constraints creating feedback. However, prior research indicates that 20 to 71 percent of students receiving feedback do not engage in any text revision. Despite these concerning figures, students' non-engagement has not received widespread attention, likely due to fragmented evidence from a few grade levels and writing tasks disconnected from regular teaching. Further, whether the issue persists when generative AI generates the feedback is unclear. The present study investigates what percentage of students behaviorally engage with feedback from generative AI in authentic classroom learning contexts. We analyzed data from an educational technology company, including 655 teacher-generated writing tasks involving 14,236 students across grades 1-12. Our findings show that around half of the students did not revise a single character in the text after receiving feedback. The percentage was similar across grade levels, task types, or feedback characteristics. We discuss the importance of including the percentage of engaged students as an additional metric in feedback research to achieve the goal that no student is left behind.},

Previous research has mainly dealt with achievement emotions which are experienced in specific situations such as exams or learning situations in mathematics (e.g. enjoyment or anxiety). Some achievement emotions are rather experienced in social contexts in mathematics and are closely related to the self. These emotions such as shame are assumed to be also relevant for mathematics achievement. However, a reliable and valid instrument is missing to measure shame in mathematics. Validity evidence for the newly developed Shame in Mathematics Questionnaire (SHAME-Q) was collected in three studies with pre-service primary teachers. Study 1 investigated the content validity by conducting a systematic expert panel study. Study 2 and study 3 examined with two different samples the factorial structure and relations to other constructs in terms of discriminant (enjoyment) and convergent (anxiety) validity as well as to pre-service teachers' grade in school mathematics, their intention to teach mathematics at school, and gender. The data supported strongly the validity assumptions as well as reliability and parsimony of the instrument. Psychometric limitations of SHAME-Q and applicability of the questionnaire are discussed.},

Analysis of target students' journals revealed that their writing incorporated both writing symbols and mathematical symbols. These symbols were more complementary for those students whose writing increased to the higher levels during instruction. Moreover, this growth appeared to be promoted by the teacher herself, who systematically sought verbal explanations of solutions and written interpretations of diagrams and numerical patterns.},

In our experiment, we presented subjects with a difficult problem that turned on their ability to draw valid causal inferences from empirical data. As expected, subjects highest in numeracy -- a measure of the ability and disposition to make use of quantitative information -- did substantially better than less numerate ones when the data were presented as results from a study of a new skin rash treatment. Also as expected, subjects' responses became politically polarized -- and even less accurate -- when the same data were presented as results from the study of a gun control ban. But contrary to the prediction of SCT, such polarization did not abate among subjects highest in numeracy; instead, it increased. This outcome supported ICT, which predicted that more numerate subjects would use their quantitative-reasoning capacity selectively to conform their interpretation of the data to the result most consistent with their political outlooks. We discuss the theoretical and practical significance of these findings.},

  abstract = {When new information is presented to learners, it must be processed in a severely limited working memory. Learning reduces working memory limitations by enabling the use of schemas, stored in long-term memory, to process information more efficiently. Several instructional techniques have been designed to facilitate schema construction and automation by reducing working memory load. Recently, however, strong evidence has emerged that the effectiveness of these techniques depends very much on levels of learner expertise. Instructional techniques that are highly effective with inexperienced learners can lose their effectiveness and even have negative consequences when used with more experienced learners. We call this phenomenon the expertise reversal effect. In this article, we review the empirical literature on the interaction between instructional techniques and levels of learner experience that led to the identification of the expertise reversal effect.

In the German political discourse, the concept has been introduced without a proper analysis and critical discussion of prior approaches and evidence of the concept and its impact on adult outcomes. In this paper I briefly introduce the historical discourse on future skills of the last 20 years. Based on existing systematic literature reviews and evidence syntheses I summarise the current state-of-the art of research and identify 9 fundamental problems of the concept and funding of future skill initiatives. Among others, the missing connection and systematisation regarding earlier approaches, the missing evidence of effects of future skills on adult outcomes and the lack of measurement approaches are identified as important shortcomings for the promotion of future skills. As an alternative approach I discuss the funding of transfer research within and outside of a domain of expertise.},

The loss scales as a power-law with model size, dataset size, and the amount of compute used for training, with some trends spanning more than seven orders of magnitude. Other architectural details such as network width or depth have minimal effects within a wide range. Simple equations govern the dependence of overfitting on model/dataset size and the dependence of training speed on model size. These relationships allow us to determine the optimal allocation of a fixed compute budget. Larger models are significantly more sample-efficient, such that optimally compute-efficient training involves training very large models on a relatively modest amount of data and stopping significantly before convergence.},

In a computer-supported collaborative learning setting, eleventh-grade science students were randomly assigned to one of two conditions to solve problems in Newtonian kinematics. In one condition, students solved ill-structured problems in groups followed by well-structured problems individually. In the other condition, students solved well-structured problems in small groups followed by well-structured problems individually. Finally, all students solved ill-structured problems individually. Groups who solved ill-structured problems expectedly struggled with defining and analyzing the problems, resulting in poor quality of solutions. However, despite failing in their collaborative efforts, these students outperformed their counterparts in the well-structured condition on individual near- and far-transfer measures subsequently, suggesting a latent productivity in what initially seemed to be failure.},

We then report findings from an ongoing program of research on PF in mathematical problem solving in 3 Singapore public schools with significantly different mathematical ability profiles, ranging from average to lower ability. In the 1st study, 7th-grade mathematics students from intact classes experienced 1 of 2 conditions: (a) PF, in which students collaboratively solved complex problems on average speed without any instructional support or scaffolds up until a teacher-led consolidation; or (b) direct instruction (DI), in which the teacher provided strong instructional support, scaffolding, and feedback. Findings suggested that although PF students generated a diversity of linked representations and methods for solving the complex problems, they were ultimately unsuccessful in their problem-solving efforts. Yet despite seemingly failing in their problem-solving efforts, PF students significantly outperformed DI students on the well-structured and complex problems on the posttest. They also demonstrated greater representation flexibility in solving average speed problems involving graphical representations, a representation that was not targeted during instruction. The 2nd and 3rd studies, conducted in schools with students of significantly lower mathematical ability, largely replicated the findings of the 1st study. Findings and implications of PF for theory, design of learning, and future research are discussed.},

We then conducted a meta-analysis of 173 studies specifically coding the nature of the flipped implementation. In contrast to many claims, most in-class sessions are not modified based on the flipped implementation. Furthermore, it was flipping followed by a more traditional class and not active learning that was more effective. Drawing on related research, we proposed a more specific model for flipping, ``Fail, Flip, Fix, and Feed'' whereby students are asked to first engage in generating solutions to novel problems even if they fail to generate the correct solutions, before receiving instructions.},

Students from two Singapore public schools with significantly different prior math achievement profiles were asked to design solutions to complex problems               prior               to receiving instruction on the targeted concepts. Process results revealed that students who were significantly dissimilar in prior math achievement seemed to be strikingly similar in terms of their inventive production, that is, the variety of solutions they were able to design. Interestingly, it was inventive production that had a stronger association with learning from PF than pre-existing differences in math achievement. These findings, consistent across both topics, demonstrate the value of engaging students in opportunities for inventive production while learning math, regardless of prior math achievement.},

  abstract = {Background: -Video-based teaching, a distance learning tools is widely beingused in the present COVID-19 pandemic. Present study compares cognitive and affective domains learning outcomes between traditional and video-based physiology lecture. Methods and material: -A total of 25female students of Applied Medical College, Prince Sattam bin Abdul Aziz University, kingdom of Saudi Arabia during 2019 were selected for the study. Physiology course consist of 45 credit hours in a fifteen-week semester. Students were evaluated by various methods for different levels of cognitive and affective domains between traditional method of endocrine physiology lecture session and video-based digestive physiology lecture session. Marks obtained by each student in all the assessment methods of cognitive and affective domains were calculated to get a total mean score and expressed in percentage and compared between the traditional and video-based physiology lecture. Results: -The total mean score for all the assessment methods of the cognitive domains in the digestive physiology lecture with video was 70\% and endocrine lecture without video was 50\%.The total mean score for affective domain in the digestive physiology lecture with video was 80\% and endocrine lecture without video was 50\%.Cognitive domain show no major difference between traditional endocrine physiology and video-based digestive physiology lecture, while student performance was good for affective domain in the lecture supported by video. Conclusion: -Video-based teaching helps the learner to achieve objectives of the different levels of affective domain compared to cognitive domain as well as compared to traditional lecture with no video.},

  abstract = {Abstract             This review explores the frontiers of large language models (LLMs) in psychological applications. Psychology has undergone several theoretical changes, and the current use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, particularly LLMs, promises to open up new research directions. We aim to provide a detailed exploration of how LLMs are transforming psychological research. We discuss the impact of LLMs across various branches of psychology---including cognitive and behavioral, clinical and counseling, educational and developmental, and social and cultural psychology---highlighting their ability to model patterns, cognition, and behavior similar to those observed in humans. Furthermore, we explore the ability of such models to generate coherent, contextually relevant text, offering innovative tools for literature reviews, hypothesis generation, experimental designs, experimental subjects, and data analysis in psychology. We emphasize the importance of addressing technical and ethical challenges, including data privacy, the ethics of using LLMs in psychological research, and the need for a deeper understanding of these models' limitations. Researchers should use LLMs responsibly in psychological studies, adhering to ethical standards and considering the potential consequences of deploying these technologies in sensitive areas. Overall, this review provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of LLMs in psychology, exploring the potential benefits and challenges. We hope it can serve as a call to action for researchers to responsibly leverage LLMs' advantages while addressing the associated risks.},

We aim to engage students in the learning material by attempting a problem followed by peer marking based on some given solution guideline before they are exposed to another similar problem to solve during the small group classes. We design a quasi-experiment to evaluate the effect of peer marking by introducing an incentive in one such problem set and not in the other. The solution to the class problem is to act as the `incentive', to be released only to the participants of the peer assessment. Using the data of two units from two UK universities and `incentives' as instrumental variables to participation, our quantitative findings reveal the effect of participating in one more peer marking as a 3\% increase in final marks on average. The qualitative analysis based on focus group discussions shows that the process increases student engagement, satisfaction, confidence and overall learning responsibility. The challenges often lie to establish a clear understanding of the purpose and the process of peer marking to ensure student buy-in to the system.},

The two instructions were identical in every other way. The results show that the attitudes of the college students were positively affected by the relationship building strategies in a statistically significant way (p = .025) and that learning gains were also positively affected at a very near-significant level (p = .052).

  abstract = {This study investigates the effects of adaptive feedback generated by large language models (LLMs), specifically ChatGPT, on performance in a written diagnostic reasoning task among German pre-service teachers (n~=~269). Additionally, the study analyzed user evaluations of the feedback and feedback processing time. Diagnostic reasoning, a critical skill for making informed pedagogical decisions, was assessed through a writing task integrated into a teacher preparation course. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either adaptive feedback generated by ChatGPT or static feedback prepared in advance by a human expert, which was identical for all participants in that condition, before completing a second writing task. The findings reveal that ChatGPT-generated adaptive feedback significantly improved the quality of justification in the students' writing compared to the static feedback written by an expert. However, no significant difference was observed in decision accuracy between the two groups, suggesting that the type and source of feedback did not impact decision-making processes. Additionally, students who had received LLM-generated adaptive feedback spent more time processing the feedback and subsequently wrote longer texts, indicating longer engagement with the feedback and the task. Participants also rated adaptive feedback as more useful and interesting than static feedback, aligning with previous research on the motivational benefits of adaptive feedback. The study highlights the potential of LLMs like ChatGPT as valuable tools in educational settings, particularly in large courses where providing adaptive feedback is challenging.},

  abstract = {Video games are becoming increasingly monetized with the addition of~in-game purchasing options, which has prompted some comparisons of these products to electronic gaming machines. The expansion and sophistication of `microtransaction' options in online games (e.g., `loot boxes') has also led to concerns about vulnerable users (e.g., adolescents) overspending on these schemes. Currently, there are limited regulatory and/or consumer protection frameworks for video game monetization schemes. This conceptual paper explores some potential social responsibility measures for monetized gaming products to stimulate further discussion and~developments in this area. Loot boxes are a focus of this discussion given the current debate on their legality, i.e., similarity to electronic gambling machines. Drawing on social responsibility principles and research in the field of gambling studies, we outline some potential measures in the areas of: (1) game design and in-game purchasing system characteristics, (2) transparency and accuracy of game design and features, (3) broad consumer protection measures, and (4) consumer information and industry accountability. It is hoped that this paper will encourage further discussion among academics, regulators, and the industry. An empirical evidence base is needed to inform the design and implementation of countermeasures for monetization schemes that increase risk of gaming-related~harm for some users.},

Mediation analyses showed narcissism was indirectly associated with POG via online gaming motives of escape and fantasy among role-playing game players and the total sample. Sadism was directly associated with POG among first-person shooter game players and indirectly with POG via online gaming motives of escape and fantasy among role-playing game players and the total sample.

  abstract = {New competency-based examinations have recently been introduced in many federal states in Germany. In order to test the effectiveness of these new style examinations, 11th grade students (age 16 years) were asked to complete analysis tasks in maths without having been taught the topic of the exam. The tasks in the questions were examples taken from the new exam of the German Zentralabitur, which is usually written by students in Grade 13 when they are aged 18-19 years. As a comparative test, these students were also asked to complete analysis tasks taken from exams written before the introduction of this German Zentralabitur. Only two students out of a total of 18 failed the newly introduced competency-based task exam. The results from the comparative exam revealed that the students were unable to achieve a sufficient grade. Sixty three per cent of them achieved the lowest grade, ``ungen{\"u}gend'' (6) on the typical German 6-scale grading. This was because the students were unable to answer the questions. Furthermore, the evaluation of the competency-based tasks and additional work sheet material provided showed that most of the information necessary to answer the questions correctly was provided for the students, in detailed descriptions, figures and tables. Thus, reading competence and everyday knowledge, not mathematical understanding, was entirely sufficient to fulfil most of the tasks successfully. Even basic mathematical knowledge was redundant. On the other hand, this study has demonstrated that 11th graders are not able to cope with the much more challenging mathematical tasks dating from the time before the introduction of competency based learning. Hence the study has revealed that this kind of competence orientation applied to the German Zentralabitur evidently achieves a levelling effect, even in mathematics.},

A meta-analysis (607 effect sizes; 23,663 observations) suggests that FIs improved performance on average (  d {\enspace}={\enspace}.41) but that over one-third of the FIs decreased performance. This finding cannot be explained by sampling error, feedback sign, or existing theories. The authors proposed a preliminary FI theory (FIT) and tested it with moderator analyses. The central assumption of FIT is that FIs change the locus of attention among 3 general and hierarchically organized levels of control: task learning, task motivation, and meta-tasks (including self-related) processes. The results suggest that FI effectiveness decreases as attention moves up the hierarchy closer to the self and away from the task. These findings are further moderated by task characteristics that are still poorly understood. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {In technology empowered classrooms teachers receive real-time data about students' performance and progress on teacher dashboards. Dashboards have the potential to enhance teachers' feedback practices and complement human-prompted feedback that is initiated by teachers themselves or students asking questions. However, such enhancement requires teachers to integrate dashboards into their professional routines. How teachers shift between dashboard-and human-prompted feedback could be indicative of this integration. We therefore examined in 65 K-12 lessons: i) differences between human- and dashboard-prompted feedback; ii) how teachers alternated between human- and dashboard-prompted feedback (distribution patterns); and iii) how these distribution patterns were associated with the given feedback type: task, process, personal, metacognitive, and social feedback. The three sources of feedback resulted in different types of feedback: Teacher-prompted feedback was predominantly personal and student-prompted feedback mostly resulted in task feedback, whereas dashboard-prompted feedback was equally likely to be task, process, or personal feedback. We found two distribution patterns of dashboard-prompted feedback within a lesson: either given in one sequence together (blocked pattern) or alternated with student- and teacher-prompted feedback (mixed pattern). The distribution pattern affected the type of dashboard-prompted feedback given. In blocked patterns, dashboard-prompted feedback was mostly personal, whereas in mixed patterns task feedback was most prevalent. Hence, both sources of feedback instigation as well as the distribution of dashboard-prompted feedback affected the type of feedback given by teachers. Moreover, when teachers advanced the integration of dashboard-prompted feedback in their professional routines as indicated by mixed patterns, more effective types of feedback were given.},

The development of TPACK by teachers is critical to effective teaching with technology. The paper begins with a brief introduction to the complex, ill-structured nature of teaching. The nature of technologies (both analog and digital) is considered, as well as how the inclusion of technology in pedagogy further complicates teaching. The TPACK framework for teacher knowledge is described in detail as a complex interaction among three bodies of knowledge: content, pedagogy, and technology. The interaction of these bodies of knowledge, both theoretically and in practice, produces the types of flexible knowledge needed to successfully integrate technology use into teaching.},

Each completed three sessions under the same condition. In a fourth session, LLM users were reassigned to Brain-only group (LLM-to-Brain), and Brain-only users were reassigned to LLM condition (Brain-to-LLM). A total of 54 participants took part in Sessions 1-3, with 18 completing session 4. We used electroencephalography (EEG) to assess cognitive load during essay writing, and analyzed essays using NLP, as well as scoring essays with the help from human teachers and an AI judge. Across groups, NERs, n-gram patterns, and topic ontology showed within-group homogeneity. EEG revealed significant differences in brain connectivity: Brain-only participants exhibited the strongest, most distributed networks; Search Engine users showed moderate engagement; and LLM users displayed the weakest connectivity. Cognitive activity scaled down in relation to external tool use. In session 4, LLM-to-Brain participants showed reduced alpha and beta connectivity, indicating under-engagement. Brain-to-LLM users exhibited higher memory recall and activation of occipito-parietal and prefrontal areas, similar to Search Engine users. Self-reported ownership of essays was the lowest in the LLM group and the highest in the Brain-only group. LLM users also struggled to accurately quote their own work. While LLMs offer immediate convenience, our findings highlight potential cognitive costs. Over four months, LLM users consistently underperformed at neural, linguistic, and behavioral levels. These results raise concerns about the long-term educational implications of LLM reliance and underscore the need for deeper inquiry into AI's role in learning.},

  abstract = {Previous studies have shown that teachers' gestures are beneficial for student learning. In this research, we investigate whether teachers' gestures have comparable effects in face-to-face live instruction and video-based instruction. We provided sixty-three 7--10~year old students with instruction about mathematical equivalence problems (e.g., 3~+~4~+~5~=~\_\_~+~5). Students were assigned to one of four experimental conditions in a 2~{\texttimes}~2 factorial design that varied (1) instruction medium (video vs. live), and (2) instruction modality (speech vs. speech~+~gesture). There was no main effect of medium: The same amount of learning occurred whether instruction was done live or on video. There was a main effect of modality: Speech instruction accompanied by gesture resulted in significantly more learning and transfer than instruction conveyed through speech only. Gesture's effect on instruction was stronger for video instruction than live instruction. These findings suggest that there may be a limit to gesture's role in communication that results in student learning.},

The factors               amount of science education classes               and               amount of science classes               have been operationalised in terms of ECTS credit points.               N               \,=\,438 pre-service science teachers from six universities in Germany, Chile and Canada voluntarily and anonymously responded to an established multiple-choice instrument for assessing SRC, which has been developed by the authors and is available in German, Spanish and English. Multiple linear regression analyses show that the included factors explain a proportion of about 9\% of the pre-service science teachers' SRC. The factor               amount of science classes               is the only significant predictor and can be seen as an indicator of learning science content knowledge. These findings support the assumption of science content knowledge being a prerequisite for developing pre-service science teachers' SRC.},

Fingerrechnen, Probleme beim Faktenabruf, Z{\"a}hlen im mehrstelligen Bereich, Rechenaufgaben mit {\"U}bertrag, Selbstkorrekturen) sind auch bei Kindern mit AD(H)S ohne Rechenst{\"o}rung zu beobachten und deshalb von geringem Nutzen f{\"u}r die Differenzialdiagnose zwischen Rechenst{\"o}rung und sekund{\"a}rer Rechenschw{\"a}che. Der Gesamtpunktwertwert im Dyskalkulietest Basis-Math 4--8 ( Moser Opitz et al., 2010 ) sowie unplausible Subtraktionsfehler wurden als kognitiver Marker f{\"u}r eine Rechenst{\"o}rung, die Anzahl der Selbstkorrekturen als Marker f{\"u}r AD(H)S vorgeschlagen. Methodik: In der vorliegenden Studie wurden anhand einer klinischen Stichprobe von 51 Kindern mit durchschnittlichem IQ und Schwierigkeiten im Rechnen explorativ hierarchische Clusteranalysen berechnet, in welche die Klassenstufe, der IQ, der Basis-Math-Gesamtwert und die Anzahl der Selbstkorrekturen als Variablen mit eingingen. Ergebnisse: Es konnten eine Subgruppe mit Rechenst{\"o}rung sowie vier Subgruppen mit sekund{\"a}rer Rechenschw{\"a}che (zwei mit Aufmerksamkeitsdefizit, eine mit Depression und eine sehr kleine Subgruppe mit hohem IQ) getrennt werden. Schlussfolgerung: Der Dyskalkulietest Basis-Math 4--8 ( Moser Opitz et al., 2010 ) kann wertvolle Hinweise f{\"u}r die Differenzialdiagnose von prim{\"a}rer Rechenst{\"o}rung und sekund{\"a}rer Rechenschw{\"a}che liefern, um die Entscheidung f{\"u}r weiterf{\"u}hrende Behandlungen zu optimieren.},

The authors of the present article respectfully disagree with this proposal and suggest that any interpretation of J. Krueger and R. A. Mueller's results is hampered because those authors used unreliable tests and inappropriate measures of relevant mediating variables.

  abstract = {Background Although computer-based formative assessment systems with automated feedback can effectively foster learning, such systems have been criticized for often lacking feedback-related choices. Aims This experiment aimed to investigate the benefits of introducing learner choices over feedback and students' feedback-retrieval behavior when its retrieval is optional. Method 160 undergraduates worked on a computer-based geometry assessment. They either received system-administered, immediate elaborated feedback (n~=~80; system-administered group) or chose after each task whether they wanted to retrieve the feedback or not (n~=~80; choice group). The assessment system tracked the time spent on the feedback, transfer performance, and feedback-retrieval behavior in the choice group, while students repeatedly rated their control-value appraisals and emotions. Data was analyzed with mixed-effects models. Results The choice option did not improve how students reacted to the feedback cognitively, emotionally nor motivationally but students in the choice group showed very high feedback-retrieval rates. Moreover, further analyses showed that feedback-retrieval rates declined with increasing item position and that the nonretrieval of feedback in the choice group was associated with a less pleasant emotional state compared to the system-administered feedback. Conclusion Data indicate that a task-level feedback choice may not substantially improve students' reactions to the feedback itself, but that it may be worth further investigating the determinants and consequences of the (non)retrieval of feedback. Further, results imply that students have a strong behavioral tendency to choose task-level, elaborated feedback over no feedback; this has important implications for the design of assessments with feedback-related learner choices.},

During the same period, another medium has additionally emerged and become a popular source of information for learners: online explanatory videos, chiefly from the online video sharing website YouTube. Their content and explaining quality remain to this day mostly unmonitored, as well is their educational impact in formal contexts such as schools or universities. In this study, a framework for explaining quality, which has emerged from surveying explaining skills in expert-novice face-to-face dialogues, was used to explore the explaining quality of such videos (36 YouTube explanatory videos on Kepler's laws and 15 videos on Newton's third law). The framework consists of 45 categories derived from physics education research that deal with explanation techniques. YouTube provides its own `quality measures' based on surface features including `likes', views, and comments for each video. The question is whether or not these measures provide valid information for educators and students if they have to decide which video to use. We compared the explaining quality with those measures. Our results suggest that there is a correlation between explaining quality and only one of these measures: the number of content-related comments.},

  abstract = {Science explanation videos, especially online ones, have become popular. They cover nearly all topics from school science curricula. Teachers use them in a flipped classroom. Students watch them also in their leisure time. However, there is a lack of research on guidelines that effective science explanation videos should follow. The research on instructional explanations provides essential insights into the effectiveness of science explanation videos. The goal of the present article is to develop a framework for effective science explanation videos. The development consists of two steps. First, criteria for a high explaining quality are derived from the research on effective instructional explanations. That leads to a coherent theoretical framework that requires empirical justification. The second step, therefore, is an exploration of the effects of the framework. We developed two explanation videos: one high explaining quality (HE) video following the framework and one low explaining quality (LE) video explicitly not following the framework. Both videos, however, are scientifically correct and provide the same learning opportunities. Students from a German high school assigned to two groups (n\,=\,90; n\,=\,86) watched, respectively, the HE and LE videos, and participated in tests for declarative and conceptual knowledge before and after watching the videos. The main result is that the HE group outperformed the LE group in the achievement of declarative knowledge (Cohen's d\,=\,.42, p\,=\,.007). We interpret that as an argument for the validity of the framework of effective science explanation videos presented in this article.},

  abstract = {The widespread availability of large language models (LLMs) has provoked both fear and excitement in the domain of education.On one hand, there is the concern that students will offload their coursework to LLMs, limiting what they themselves learn.On the other hand, there is the hope that LLMs might serve as scalable, personalized tutors.Here we conduct a large, pre-registered experiment involving 1200 participants to investigate how exposure to LLM-based explanations affect learning.In the experiment's learning phase, we gave participants practice problems and manipulated two key factors in a between-participants design: first, whether they were required to attempt a problem before or after seeing the correct answer, and second, whether participants were shown only the answer or were also exposed to an LLM-generated explanation of the answer.Subsequently, all participants were tested on new test questions to assess how well they had learned the underlying concepts.Overall we found that LLM-based explanations positively impacted learning relative to seeing only correct answers.The benefits were largest for those who attempted problems on their own first before consulting LLM explanations, but surprisingly this trend held even for those participants who were exposed to LLM explanations before attempting to solve practice problems on their own.An accompanying qualitative analysis revealed that these boosts in performance were indeed due to participants adopting the strategies they were shown, and that exposure to LLM explanations increased the amount people felt they learned and decreased the perceived difficulty of the test problems.},

Specifically, it examines how these aspects impact instruction and, in turn, student outcomes. In a nationally representative sample of 194 German secondary school mathematics classes, multiple measures were used to assess teacher competence, instructional quality, and students' achievement and motivation. The effect of teachers' professional competence on student outcomes was estimated in a 1-year repeated-measures design. Two-level structural equation models revealed positive effects of teachers' pedagogical content knowledge, enthusiasm for teaching, and self-regulatory skills on instructional quality, which in turn affected student outcomes. In contrast, teachers' general academic ability did not affect their instruction. The multidimensional model of teachers' professional competence introduced in this article seems suited to stimulate further research on the personal indicators of teacher quality.

  abstract = {With the ever-increasing number of news stories available online, classifying them by topic, regardless of the language they are written in, has become crucial for enhancing readers' access to relevant content. To address this challenge, we propose a teacher-student framework based on large language models (LLMs) for developing multilingual news classification models of reasonable size with no need for manual data annotation. The framework employs a Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) model as the teacher model to develop an IPTC Media Topic training dataset through automatic annotation of news articles in Slovenian, Croatian, Greek, and Catalan. The teacher model exhibits a high zero-shot performance on all four languages. Its agreement with human annotators is comparable to that between the human annotators themselves. To mitigate the computational limitations associated with the requirement of processing millions of texts daily, smaller BERT-like student models are fine-tuned on the GPT-annotated dataset. These student models achieve high performance comparable to the teacher model. Furthermore, we explore the impact of the training data size on the performance of the student models and investigate their monolingual, multilingual and zero-shot cross-lingual capabilities. The findings indicate that student models can achieve high performance with a relatively small number of training instances, and demonstrate strong zero-shot cross-lingual abilities. Finally, we publish the best-performing news topic classifier, enabling multilingual classification with the top-level categories of the IPTC Media Topic schema.},

By applying a newly developed test-based instrument to assess teachers' conceptual and situational TPK, we investigated the cognitive conditions accounting for the availability of TPK. In Study 1 (N\,=\,284), we demonstrated that the availability of TPK depended on the level of teacher expertise. In Study 2 (N\,=\,120), we examined the connectedness of TPK to its corresponding knowledge components (i.e., technological knowledge, pedagogical knowledge). We showed that teachers' TPK was only related to their pedagogical knowledge. The findings demonstrate that pedagogical expertise is a crucial prerequisite for TPK, which enables teachers to judge the potentials of technologies for varying teaching situations.},

Research on flipped and non-flipped classrooms has provided mixed findings regarding students' behavioral engagement. Using the motivation-opportunity-ability perspective and self-determination theory, in this study, we aim to empirically test how student-level motivation (i.e., autonomous and controlled), student-level ability (i.e., perceived self-efficacy), and class-level opportunity (i.e., perceived teaching quality and perceived platform quality) influence students' behavioral engagement in flipped classrooms. Data were collected with a survey completed by 1002 students in 30 classes with flipped classrooms at public and private universities and tested using hierarchical linear modeling (HLM). The results revealed that autonomous motivation, controlled motivation, perceived self-efficacy, and perceived teaching quality were critical determinants of university students' behavioral engagement in flipped classrooms. When perceived self-efficacy was high, the positive relationship between autonomous motivation and behavioral engagement became stronger. Moreover, when perceived platform quality was high, the positive relationship between autonomous motivation and behavioral engagement became stronger. In addition, when perceived platform quality was low, the negative relationship between controlled motivation and behavioral engagement became stronger. Follow-up interviews with the students emphasized five contradictions in flipped classrooms that hindered behavioral engagement---there was tension between types of learning, the videos were boring, not all students actually participated in the discussions, students lacked sufficient time for in-class activities, and teachers did not have good interaction skills. Implications of flipped classrooms are also discussed.},

  abstract = {Maintaining information in working memory often competes with concurrent processing of other information. This is reflected in the cognitive load effect, referring to the observation that processing tasks with a higher cognitive load result in lower memory performance. The cognitive load effect has been shown on many occasions in complex span tasks, which combine maintenance of memory items with a processing demand interleaved in between the presentation of the memory items. Two models of working memory, the Time-Based Resource-Sharing (TBRS) model, and the Serial Order in a Box -- Complex Span (SOB-CS) model, offer competing explanations for the cognitive load effect. Both lead to the prediction that a cognitive load effect should also be found in the Brown-Peterson task, in which the processing demand is inserted after the presentation of all of the memory items. Across three experiments, we show that (1) the cognitive load effect is consistently larger in the complex span task than in the Brown-Peterson task, and (2) the cognitive load effect is mostly absent in the Brown-Peterson task, with one exception. The current versions of the TBRS and SOB-CS models cannot account for these findings. We discuss what new assumptions are necessary for these models to explain our findings and consider alternative accounts explaining the current observations purely in terms of free time instead of cognitive load.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The positivity principle states that people learn better from instructors who display positive emotions rather than negative emotions. In two experiments, students viewed a short video lecture on a statistics topic in which an instructor stood next to a series of slides as she lectured and then they took either an immediate test (Experiment 1) or a delayed test (Experiment 2). In a between-subjects design, students saw an instructor who used her voice, body movement, gesture, facial expression, and eye gaze to display one of four emotions while lecturing: happy (positive/active), content (positive/passive), frustrated (negative/active), or bored (negative/passive). First, learners were able to recognize the emotional tone of the instructor in an instructional video lecture, particularly by more strongly rating a positive instructor as displaying positive emotions and a negative instructor as displaying negative emotions (in Experiments 1 and 2). Second, concerning building a social connection during learning, learners rated a positive instructor as more likely to facilitate learning, more credible, and more engaging than a negative instructor (in Experiments 1 and 2). Third, concerning cognitive engagement during learning, learners reported paying more attention during learning for a positive instructor than a negative instructor (in Experiments 1 and 2). Finally, concerning learning outcome, learners who had a positive instructor scored higher than learners who had a negative instructor on a delayed posttest (Experiment 2) but not an immediate posttest (Experiment 1). Overall, there is evidence for the positivity principle and the cognitive-affective model of e-learning from which it is derived.},

We identified 74 published and unpublished papers that experimentally manipulated an independent variable and measured an authentic educational outcome within an ecologically valid educational context. Our analyses included 92 independent effect sizes with 38,377 participants. Our results indicated that interventions were generally effective, with an average mean effect size of d = 0.49 (95\% confidence interval = [0.43, 0.56]). Although there were descriptive differences in the effect sizes across several moderator variables considered in our analyses, the only significant difference found was for the type of experimental design, with randomized designs having smaller effect sizes than quasi-experimental designs. This work illustrates the extent to which interventions and accompanying theories have been tested via experimental methods and provides information about appropriate next steps in developing and testing effective motivation interventions in education.},

This study was undertaken in four sections of the same College English 1 (E1) course over two consecutive semesters at a South Korean university. A total of 79 students enrolled in the E1 course participated in the study. Of the participants, 39 learned English using a communicative language teaching approach, whereas 40 studied English in a flipped learning manner. Data were gathered from the students' achievements in three major tasks, their responses to three surveys, and the instructor's notes on the students' engagement in the process of their English learning. Findings demonstrate that the students in the flipped classroom achieved higher average scores in their final three tasks than those in the non-flipped classroom, but only the final examination mean score indicated statistical significance. However, surveys indicated that most students in this study seemed to enjoy learning English in a flipped learning environment. Also, the instructor found the students in the flipped classroom to be more engaged in the learning process than those in the non-flipped classroom. Pedagogical implications for effective English teaching are discussed.},

Dies war der Ausgangspunkt daf{\"u}r, dass im Rahmen des Entwicklungsprogrammes BiSS bundesweit an Schulen Sprachf{\"o}rderung in verschiedenen Unterrichtsf{\"a}chern implementiert und durch Begleitforschung evaluiert werden sollte. Das Evaluationsprojekt EvaFa untersucht dabei die mathematikspezifische Sprachf{\"o}rderung von Schulen aus dem BiSS-Programm. Entsprechend besch{\"a}ftigt sich dieser Beitrag mit der Frage, inwiefern Sch{\"u}lerinnen und Sch{\"u}ler, die an einem sprachf{\"o}rdernden Mathematikunterricht teilnehmen, von einem Jahr Sprachf{\"o}rderung profitieren und h{\"o}here Textverstehensleistungen bzw. einen gr{\"o}{\ss}eren Fachwortschatz aufweisen. Hierf{\"u}r wurden von den Sch{\"u}lerinnen und Sch{\"u}lern eines exemplarischen Sprachf{\"o}rderverbundes bestehend aus acht Klassen in einem Pre-Post-Design u.\,a. soziodemographische Hintergrundmerkmale, sprachliche F{\"a}higkeiten, die Verf{\"u}gbarkeit von Fachw{\"o}rtern, die mathematische Kompetenz, das Textaufgabenverst{\"a}ndnis sowie die Einsch{\"a}tzung unterrichtlicher Aspekte l{\"a}ngsschnittlich erhoben. F{\"u}r eine Stichprobe von 133 Sch{\"u}lerinnen und Sch{\"u}ler der 5. und 6.~Jahrgangsstufe werden diese Daten n{\"a}her analysiert, wobei sich zum einen zeigt, dass Sch{\"u}lerinnen und Sch{\"u}ler verschiedene unterrichtliche Aspekte sehr differenziert wahrnehmen und f{\"u}r Ver{\"a}nderungen sensibel sind. Zum anderen zeigen sich beim mathematischen Textaufgabenverst{\"a}ndnis signifikante Zuw{\"a}chse zwischen den beiden Messzeitpunkten im F{\"o}rderzeitraum.           ,              Abstract             In recent years it has become increasingly clear what meaning language has for the acquisition of professional competences and what relevance a~continuous language promotion has in all school subjects. This was the starting point for the BiSS funding program, which implemented language support at various schools in schools across Germany, and which was to be evaluated through accompanying research. One such evaluation project was the EvaFa project. This examined the mathematics-specific language support of schools from the BiSS program. Accordingly, the present article deals with the question of to what extent students who take part in language-promoting mathematics lessons benefit from language support from one year and have higher levels of text comprehension or a~larger vocabulary. For this purpose, the longitudinally collected student data from eight classes, which formed a~thematically homogeneous language support cluster, were analyzed as part of a~pre-post design (including socio-demographic background characteristics, language skills, the availability of technical words, mathematical competence, understanding of word problems and the assessment of teaching aspects). The analysis of the sample (133 pupils in the 5th and 6th~grades) shows that pupils perceive different teaching aspects in a~very differentiated manner and are quite sensitive to changes in the teaching of mathematics. In addition, the mathematical understanding of word problems shows significant increases between the two measurement times in the funding period.},

Proper measurement of the different types of cognitive load can help us understand why the effectiveness and efficiency of learning environments may differ as a function of instructional formats and learner characteristics. In this article, we present a ten-item instrument for the measurement of the three types of cognitive load. Principal component analysis on data from a lecture in statistics for PhD students (n = 56) in psychology and health sciences revealed a three-component solution, consistent with the types of load that the different items were intended to measure. This solution was confirmed by a confirmatory factor analysis of data from three lectures in statistics for different cohorts of bachelor students in the social and health sciences (ns = 171, 136, and 148), and received further support from a randomized experiment with university freshmen in the health sciences (n = 58).},

Overall, our findings suggest that the effects of ITSs on learning and performance in K-12 education are generally positive but are found to be mitigated when compared to non-intelligent tutoring systems. However, additional research with longer interventions and increased sample sizes with greater diversity is warranted. Additionally, the ethical implications of using AI for teaching should be investigated.},

  abstract = {Large pre-trained language models have been shown to store factual knowledge in their parameters, and achieve state-of-the-art results when fine-tuned on downstream NLP tasks. However, their ability to access and precisely manipulate knowledge is still limited, and hence on knowledge-intensive tasks, their performance lags behind task-specific architectures. Additionally, providing provenance for their decisions and updating their world knowledge remain open research problems. Pre-trained models with a differentiable access mechanism to explicit non-parametric memory can overcome this issue, but have so far been only investigated for extractive downstream tasks. We explore a general-purpose fine-tuning recipe for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) -- models which combine pre-trained parametric and non-parametric memory for language generation. We introduce RAG models where the parametric memory is a pre-trained seq2seq model and the non-parametric memory is a dense vector index of Wikipedia, accessed with a pre-trained neural retriever. We compare two RAG formulations, one which conditions on the same retrieved passages across the whole generated sequence, the other can use different passages per token. We fine-tune and evaluate our models on a wide range of knowledge-intensive NLP tasks and set the state-of-the-art on three open domain QA tasks, outperforming parametric seq2seq models and task-specific retrieve-and-extract architectures. For language generation tasks, we find that RAG models generate more specific, diverse and factual language than a state-of-the-art parametric-only seq2seq baseline.},

  abstract = {Objective At present, current didactic teaching delivery method help nursing students apply theory to clinical situations in an inefficient way. The flipped classroom (FC), a novel teaching mode emphasizing self-study and critical thinking, has generated interest in nursing education in China. However, there are a gap in the literature and no consistent outcomes of current studies which compared FC and lecture-based learning (LBL), and no systematic review has comprehensively compared theoretical scores as an affected outcome in FC versus LBL modes. Methods In this review, we analyze flipped-learning nursing students' scores, and aim to assess the efficacy and provide a deeper understanding of the FC in nursing education. Following the inclusion criteria, articles were obtained by searching PubMed, Embase and Chinese data, including the China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Data, and VIP database until 3 January 2020. Data were extracted from eligible articles and quality was assessed. A meta-analysis was then performed using a random effects model with a standardized mean value (SMD) and a 95\% confidence interval (CI).32 studies were included after reviewing 2,439 citations. All studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The FC theoretical knowledge scores in FC were significantly positively affected compared to those of the traditional classroom (SMD = 1.33, 95\% CI: 1.02--1.64; P {$<$} 0.001). In addition, 23 studies reported skill scores, indicating significant difference between the FC mode and LBL mode (SMD = 1.58, 95\%CI: 1.23--1.93; P {$<$} 0.001). Conclusions The results of this meta-analysis suggest that compared to the LBL teaching method, the FC mode dose significantly improve Chinese nursing students' theoretical scores. However,},

  abstract = {In second language education, the flipped classroom has been widely researched and increasingly applied as a teaching approach to improve the academic performance and engagement of English as a foreign language learners. However, learner engagement is a multidimensional construct, and not much empirical evidence exists about whether the flipped classroom can lead to a significant improvement in learners' behavioural, emotional, cognitive, and social engagement in the EFL class. To fill this gap, this study adopted a mixed-methods research approach to evaluate the impact of the flipped College English Listening and Speaking class on four-dimension learner engagement in a mainland China context. After an eight-week intervention we compared the experimental group (the flipped class, N = 34) and the control group (the non-flipped class, N = 35). Findings demonstrate that after eight weeks of flipped instruction, students in the flipped class achieved higher mean scores on the post-test engagement questionnaires in behavioural, emotional, cognitive, and social engagement. However, the difference in emotional engagement between the flipped and non-flipped classes was not statistically significant. Semi-structured interviews revealed several factors responsible for learner engagement in the flipped EFL classroom. Positive influencing factors were learning environment, instructor presence, learning content, and learner presence, whereas negative aspects included the excessive workload on learners, lack of learning preparedness, lengthy videos, and technical challenges. Based on the findings, we would argue that the instructor and other educational stakeholders should provide more support to cater to learners' emotional engagement and help learners cope with the challenges encountered throughout the flipped learning process. The study may assist teaching professionals and researchers obtain a clearer understanding of flipped instruction in the EFL context and design and implement the flipped class by considering the positive and negative elements affecting learner engagement.},

  abstract = {Instructing the model to generate a sequence of intermediate steps, a.k.a., a chain of thought (CoT), is a highly effective method to improve the accuracy of large language models (LLMs) on arithmetics and symbolic reasoning tasks. However, the mechanism behind CoT remains unclear. This work provides a theoretical understanding of the power of CoT for decoder-only transformers through the lens of expressiveness. Conceptually, CoT empowers the model with the ability to perform inherently serial computation, which is otherwise lacking in transformers, especially when depth is low. Given input length \$n\$, previous works have shown that constant-depth transformers with finite precision \${\textbackslash}mathsf\{poly\}(n)\$ embedding size can only solve problems in \${\textbackslash}mathsf\{TC\}{\textasciicircum}0\$ without CoT. We first show an even tighter expressiveness upper bound for constant-depth transformers with constant-bit precision, which can only solve problems in \${\textbackslash}mathsf\{AC\}{\textasciicircum}0\$, a proper subset of \$ {\textbackslash}mathsf\{TC\}{\textasciicircum}0\$. However, with \$T\$ steps of CoT, constant-depth transformers using constant-bit precision and \$O({\textbackslash}log n)\$ embedding size can solve any problem solvable by boolean circuits of size \$T\$. Empirically, enabling CoT dramatically improves the accuracy for tasks that are hard for parallel computation, including the composition of permutation groups, iterated squaring, and circuit value problems, especially for low-depth transformers.},

The research, conducted with middle school mathematics teachers in Chongqing, China, employed structural equation modelling (SEM) to explore the relationships between various TPACK components. The study establishes discriminant validity and demonstrates an excellent fit for the SEM model. Notably, it uncovers significant correlations within the TPACK framework, with a special emphasis on the influence of XK. The findings indicate that XK, in conjunction with Pedagogical Knowledge (PK), Pedagogical Content Knowledge (PCK), and Technological Content Knowledge (TCK), considerably impacts the overall TPACK construct. The research highlights the critical influence of XK on key TPACK components, such as Technological Pedagogical Knowledge (TPK), PCK, and TPACK itself. These results underline the importance of integrating XK in professional development programs focused on TPACK, accentuating its vital role in effectively integrating technology in mathematics education. This study significantly contributes to the academic understanding of TPACK's complex dynamics. It provides essential insights for enhancing technology integration in mathematics education, offering valuable guidance for educational practitioners and policymakers.},

Contrary to this, productive failure (as well as invention learning, desirable difficulties and other problem-solving-first) frameworks suggest that scaffolded problem-solving activities (a generation phase) preceding explicit instruction enhance learners' performance. The reported experimental study investigated the effectiveness of different levels of instructional guidance provided to students during the learning phase preceding explicit instruction in standard solution procedures in enhancing students' engagement and transfer problem-solving skills. Specifically, the study compared partially-guided or unguided attempts at generating problem solutions as opposed to comprehensive guidance, in the form of a worked example. Levels of experienced cognitive load and learner motivation were evaluated in addition to delayed post-test performance scores. There were no differences between the three groups on the transfer post-test outcomes, even though the condition with fully-guided worked examples prior to the explicit instruction expectedly reduced cognitive load relative to the conditions without such guidance. There were also differences between the conditions on some sub-dimensions of the motivation scale. In general, the findings indicate that similar overall outcomes (delayed transfer performance) could be achieved by different sequences of instructional tasks aimed at achieving different sets of specific goals.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Mathematics is one of the core STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) subject disciplines. Engaging students in learning mathematics helps retain students in STEM fields and thus contributes to the sustainable development of society. To increase student engagement, some mathematics instructors have redesigned their courses using the flipped classroom approach. In this review, we examined the results of comparative studies published between 2011 and 2020 to summarize the effects of this instructional approach (vs. traditional lecturing) on students' behavioral, emotional, and cognitive engagement with mathematics courses. Thirty-three articles in K--12 and higher education contexts were included for analysis. The results suggest that the use of the flipped classroom approach may increase some aspects of behavioral engagement (e.g., interaction and attention/participation), emotional engagement (e.g., course satisfaction), and cognitive engagement (e.g., understanding of mathematics). However, we discovered that several aspects (e.g., students' attendance, mathematics anxiety, and self-regulation) of student engagement have not been thoroughly explored and are worthy of further study. The results of this review have important implications for future flipped classroom practice (e.g., engaging students in solving real-world problems), and for research on student engagement (e.g., using more objective measures, such as classroom observation) in mathematics education.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Attempting to solve problems prior to instruction may lead to a global awareness of knowledge gaps (i.e., awareness without being able to identify which specific component is lacking). These gaps may subsequently be specified by comparing students' solutions to the canonical solution. In our first experiment, the teacher highlighted specific gaps by comparing typical student solutions to the canonical solution before or after problem solving. The second experiment varied the factors form of instruction (with or without student solutions) and timing of instruction (problem-solving prior to or after instruction). Problem-solving prior to instruction triggered a global awareness of knowledge gaps. While this was beneficial for learning when combined with instruction with student solutions, our results indicate that comparing student solutions during instruction to specify the gaps is the most relevant factor.},

However, students' solutions prior to instruction are usually erroneous or incomplete. In analogy to guided discovery learning, it might therefore be fruitful to lead students towards the discovery of the canonical solution. In two quasi-experimental studies with 104 students and 175 students, respectively, we compared three conditions: problem-solving prior to instruction, guided problem-solving prior to instruction in which students were led towards the discovery of relevant solution components, and direct instruction. We replicated the beneficial effects of problem-solving prior to instruction in comparison to direct instruction on posttest items testing for conceptual knowledge. Our process analysis further revealed that guidance helped students to invent better solutions. However, the solution quality did not correlate with the posttest results in the guided condition, indicating that leading students towards the solution does not additionally promote learning. This interpretation is supported by the finding that the two conditions with problem-solving prior to instruction did not differ significantly at posttest. The second study replicated these findings with a greater sample size. The results indicate that different mechanisms underlie guided discovery learning and problem-solving prior to instruction: In guided discovery learning, the discovery of an underlying model is inherent to the method. In contrast, the effectiveness of problem-solving prior to instruction does not depend on students' discovery of the canonical solution, but on the cognitive processes related to problem-solving, which prepare students for a deeper understanding during subsequent instruction.},

Two often cited examples of instructional approaches following the PS-I scheme include Productive Failure and Invention. Despite the growing interest in PS-I approaches, to the best of our knowledge, there has not yet been a comprehensive attempt to summarize the features that define PS-I and to explain the patterns of results. Therefore, the first goal of this paper is to map the landscape of different PS-I implementations, to identify commonalities and differences in designs, and to associate the identified design features with patterns in the learning outcomes. The review shows that PS-I fosters learning only if specific design features (namely contrasting cases or building instruction on student solutions) are implemented. The second goal is to identify a set of interconnected cognitive mechanisms that may account for these outcomes. Empirical evidence from PS-I literature is associated with these mechanisms and supports an initial theory of PS-I. Finally, positive and negative effects of PS-I are explained using the suggested mechanisms.},

To reveal the role of elaboration and comparison of errors, we investigated the effect of prompting students to engage in such cognitive processes: Students in all conditions first worked on an identical problem-solving activity (targeting the comparison of fractions) without prior instruction about the targeted concepts and procedures. In the subsequent instruction phase, students in the different conditions received 1) only correct solutions, 2) correct and erroneous examples, or 3) additional comparison prompts. Students who were prompted to compare erroneous solution attempts to correct solutions significantly outperformed their peers at posttest. Elaborating on errors seemed to mediate this effect. In accordance with the theoretical assumptions, the difference between conditions was only significant for students whose initial solution resembled the erroneous examples.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Research on productive failure suggests that attempting to solve a problem prior to instruction facilitates conceptual understanding compared to receiving instruction prior to problem solving. The assumptions are that during the problem-solving phase, students activate their prior knowledge, become aware of their knowledge gaps, and discover deep features of the target content, which prepares them to better process the subsequent instruction. Unclear is whether this effect results from merely changing the order of the learning phases (i.e., instruction or problem solving first) or from additional features, such as presenting problem-solving material in the form of cases that differ in one feature at a time. Contrasting such cases may highlight the deep features and provide grounded feedback to students' problem-solving attempts. In addition, the effect of the order of instruction and problem solving on procedural fluency is still unclear. The present experiment (               N               \,=\,181, mean age\,=\,14.53) investigated in a 2\,{\texttimes}\,2 design the effects of order (instruction or problem solving first) and of contrasting cases in the problem-solving material (yes/no) on conceptual understanding and procedural fluency. Additionally, the quality and quantity of students' solution attempts from the problem-solving phase were coded. Regarding the learning outcomes, the ANOVA results suggest that for procedural fluency instruction prior to problem solving was more beneficial than problem solving prior to instruction. Merely delaying instruction did not increase conceptual understanding. The contrasting cases did not affect the quality of solution attempts, nor the posttest results. As expected, students who received instruction first generated fewer, but higher-quality solution attempts.},

  abstract = {The composite instructional design PS-I combines an initial problem-solving phase (PS) with a subsequent explicit instruction phase (I). PS-I has proven effective for conceptual learning in comparison to instructional designs with the reverse order (I-PS), especially when the explicit instruction phase productively builds on students' erroneous or incomplete (i.e., failed) solution attempts. Building on student solutions during explicit instruction may support students to integrate their intermediate knowledge (acquired during problem solving) with the newly introduced knowledge components. While these effects have been shown for learning the concept of variance in multiple studies, it remains unclear whether these effects generalize to other situations. We conducted a conceptual replication study of Loibl and Rummel (Loibl and Rummel, Learning and Instruction 34:74--85, 2014a) choosing Bayesian reasoning as target knowledge. 75 students were assigned to four conditions in a 2\,{\texttimes}\,2 design (factor 1: PS-I vs. I-PS; factor 2: instruction phase with vs. without typical student solutions). In contrast to Loibl and Rummel (2014a), we did neither find a main effect for PS-I vs. I-PS, nor for building on typical student solutions. The missing effect of PS-I can be explained by the fact that students merely activated their prior knowledge on probabilities without exploring the problem-solving space and without becoming aware of their knowledge gaps. The missing effect of building on typical student solutions can be explained by a mismatch of the solutions generated and the ones included in the explicit instruction. Therefore, building on typical student solutions did not foster an integration of students' intermediate knowledge and the introduced knowledge components.},

Although there is abundant information about their benefits and practice description, few studies provide empirical evidence of their implementation. The objective of this study was to provide initial evidence about the use of the portfolio in higher education. Concretely, we aimed 1) to explore the correlation between students' performance on the portfolio and their performance on more traditional assessment methods 2) to explore whether student's personal variables predict performance in key elements of the e-portfolio, such as individual reflections, and if these contribute to general academic performance in the course, and 3) to evaluate whether the use of the e-portfolio during a semester changes the students' self-efficacy and engagement. For this purpose, an initial sample of 73 students were recruited, and an e-portfolio (based on Mahara) was implemented over a semester. The results showed that performance on the portfolio correlated with the score obtained on multiple choice tests. There was an increase in self-efficacy after one semester of e-portfolio implementation, and engagement proved to be an important predictor of the final course grade through the mediation of individual reflections. These results offer preliminary and promising evidence about the relationship of a specific element of e-portfolios, individual reflections with several variables related to academic achievement such as self-efficacy and engagement.},

Contrary to previous findings in medicine, but similar to psychology, the majority of education replications successfully replicated the original studies. However, replications were significantly less likely to be successful when there was no overlap in authorship between the original and replicating articles. The results emphasize the importance of third-party, direct replications in helping education research improve its ability to shape education policy and practice.},

It also examined the incremental validity of personality traits above and beyond cognitive ability in predicting academic performance. Results The combined effect of cognitive ability and personality traits explained 27.8\% of the variance in academic performance. Cognitive ability was the most important predictor with a relative importance of 64\%. Conscientiousness emerged as a strong and robust predictor of performance, even when controlling for cognitive ability, and accounted for 28\% of the explained variance in academic performance. A significant moderating effect of education level was observed. The relationship of academic performance with openness, extraversion, and agreeableness demonstrated significantly larger effect sizes at the elementary/middle school level compared to the subsequent levels. Openness, despite its weak overall relative importance, was found to be an important determinant of student performance in the early years of school. Conclusion These findings reaffirm the critical role of personality traits in explaining academic performance through the most comprehensive assessment yet of these relationships.},

Both across Europe, and within each of the 27 countries, SDT's basic psychological needs---both when examined alone and when examined together---were strongly related to key indicators of well-being (happiness, life satisfaction, and meaning in life) and a key indicator of ill-being (symptoms of depression), even controlling for demographic factors and socio-economic position. Moreover, basic needs substantially and sometimes fully mediated the effects of socio-economic position on well-being, underscoring their status as crucial to human well-being.},

Clarity, cultural equivalence and relevance of the instrument were classified by seven experts. Forty-five students confirmed the ease of understanding in a pre-test. At scale-level index, the ``Goal Setting'' value was below the adequate level. Three items were considered unacceptable, and one of them was identified as a potentially problematic item. Confirmatory factor analysis showed some problems in the adjustment of the questionnaire model to the data. Self-regulated learning skills of Russian engineering students in MOOCs are moderate, with high levels in terms of ``Environment Structuring'' and ``Goal Setting'', but low in ``Help Seeking''. Self-regulated learning variables indicated no gender differences.},

In Multimedia Learning Richard Mayer explores ways of going beyond the purely verbal by combining words and pictures for effective teaching. Multimedia encyclopedias have become the latest addition to students' reference tools, and the world wide web is full of messages that combine words and pictures. Do these forms of presentation help learners? If so, what is the best way to design multimedia messages for optimal learning? Drawing upon 10 years of research, the author provides seven principles for the design of multimedia messages and a cognitive theory of multimedia learning. In short, this book summarizes research aimed at realizing the promise of multimedia learning - that is, the potential of using words and pictures together to promote human understanding.},

In each case, guided discovery was more effective than pure discovery in helping students learn and transfer. Overall, the constructivist view of learning may be best supported by methods of instruction that involve cognitive activity rather than behavioral activity, instructional guidance rather than pure discovery, and curricular focus rather than unstructured exploration.

The personalization principle is that people learn more deeply when the words in a multimedia presentation are in conversational style rather than formal style. This principle was supported in 14 out of 17 experimental tests, yielding a median effect size of d = 0.79. Some important boundary conditions are that the personalization principle may not apply to high-achieving students or long lessons. The voice principle is that people learn more deeply when the words in a multimedia message are spoken in a human voice rather than in a machine voice. This principle was supported in 5 out of 6 experimental comparisons, with a median effect size of d = 0.74. A possible boundary condition is that the voice principle may not apply when there are negative social cues such as low embodiment. The image principle is that people do not necessarily learn more deeply from a multimedia presentation when the speaker's image is on the screen rather than not on the screen. This principle is based on 14 experimental tests in which half produced negative or negligible effects, yielding a median effect size of d = 0.20. The embodiment principle is that people learn more deeply when on-screen agents display humanlike gesturing, movement, eye contact, and facial expressions. In 11 out of 11 experimental comparisons, people performed better on transfer tests when they learned from a high-embodied agent than from a low-embodied agent, yielding a median effect size of d = 0.36. A possible boundary condition is that the embodiment principle may not apply when there are negative social cues such as a machine voice.

  abstract = {Abstract             The cognitive theory of multimedia learning~(Mayer, 2021, 2022), which seeks to explain how people learn academic material from words and graphics, has developed over the past four decades. Although the name and graphical representation of the theory have evolved over the years, the core ideas have been constant---dual channels (i.e., humans have separate information processing channels for verbal and visual information), limited capacity (i.e., processing capacity is severely limited), and active processing (i.e., meaningful learning involves selecting relevant material to be processed in working memory, mentally organizing the material into coherent verbal and visual structures, and integrating them with each other and with relevant knowledge activated from long-term memory). This review describes how the theory has developed (i.e., the past), the current state of the theory (i.e., the present), and new directions for future development (i.e., the future). In addition, the review includes examples of the events and findings that led to changes in the theory. Implications for educational psychology are discussed, including 15 evidence-based principles of multimedia design.},

  abstract = {Productive Failure (PF) facilitates students' conceptual knowledge by delaying instruction until after problem solving. While PF is well investigated in middle and high school students, little is known about its effectiveness in younger students. Studies in younger samples, which implemented delayed instruction designs similar to those used in PF studies, showed mixed results. However, these studies did not implement two core design components of PF: (1) contrasting and comparing student-generated solutions and the canonical solution during the instructional phase (contrasting activity), and (2) students' collaboration in small groups during the initial problem-solving phase. Both components can be expected to contribute to the effectiveness of PF. In a quasi-experimental study with 228 fifth graders, we implemented the first component (contrasting activity) with all students to establish whether under this condition, problem solving prior to instruction would be more effective for younger students' conceptual knowledge acquisition than direct instruction (i.e., problem solving after instruction). Further, we experimentally tested the effect of the second component (collaborative vs. individual problem solving) on students' conceptual knowledge and the number of solution ideas generated during initial problem solving. We found no empirical support for either of our hypotheses. To explore the extent to which students' collaboration actually achieved its potential and relates to students' conceptual knowledge and solution ideas in PF, we conducted analyses of collaborative processes. Our study adds to the mixed results regarding the superiority of problem solving prior to instruction for young students, thus opening the discussion about age-related prerequisites as boundary conditions for PF.},

Australia is in the process of establishing an Education Evidence Base, informed by the government's 2016 Productivity Commission report. While the literature around evidence-based education is explicit in identifying its basis in medicine, there has been little medical input into its development. Interdisciplinary examination of the medical literature reveals the contested nature and troubled state of evidence-based medicine and what policymakers need to consider to maximise the benefits of this translation into education.},

A key part of automated feedback systems is an error classification component, which identifies student errors and enables appropriate, predefined feedback to be deployed. Most existing approaches to error classification use a rule-based method, which has limited capacity to generalize. Existing data-driven methods avoid these limitations but specifically require mathematical expressions in student responses to be parsed into syntax trees. This requirement is itself a limitation, since student responses are not always syntactically valid and cannot be converted into trees. In this work, we introduce a flexible method for error classification using pre-trained large language models. We demonstrate that our method can outperform existing methods in algebra error classification, and is able to classify a larger set of student responses. Additionally, we analyze common classification errors made by our method and discuss limitations of automated error classification.},

The results indicate that teachers can judge mean differences with very high accuracy ({$\tau~$}=~.85) but only consider moderate and large effects to be meaningful, indicating low sensitivity. By systematically varying different graph types, we also found that participants quickly increased their efficiency in terms of dwell time when repeatedly confronted with a specific graph type and were most sensitive to the use of stacked or clustered bar graphs.},

The empirical analyses are based on a data set from the 2012 PISA study comprising 4168 15-year-old students, who predominantly attended the ninth grade. The results show that self-beliefs (i.e. self-concept and self-efficacy) in conjunction with instrumental motivational orientation account very well for differences in emotional orientations (i.e. enjoyment and interest as well as anxiety) in mathematics. Moreover, self-concept plays a central role in explaining the other personality traits, while self-efficacy has the strongest positive effect on mathematics achievement.},

  abstract = {Writing proficiency is an essential skill for upper secondary students that can be enhanced through effective feedback. Creating feedback on writing tasks, however, is time-intensive and presents a challenge for educators, often resulting in students receiving insufficient or no feedback. The advent of text-generating large language models (LLMs) offers a promising solution, namely, automated evidence-based feedback generation. Yet, empirical evidence from randomized controlled studies about the effectiveness of LLM-generated feedback is missing. To address this issue, the current study compared the effectiveness of LLM-generated feedback to no feedback. A sample of N~=~459 upper secondary students of English as a foreign language wrote an argumentative essay. Students in the experimental group were asked to revise their text according to feedback that was generated using the LLM GPT-3.5-turbo. The control group revised their essays without receiving feedback. We assessed improvement in the revision using automated essay scoring. The results showed that LLM-generated feedback increased revision performance (d~=~.19) and task motivation (d~=~0.36). Moreover, it increased positive emotions (d~=~0.34) compared to revising without feedback. The findings highlight that using LLMs allows to create timely feedback that can positively relate to students' cognitive and affective-motivational outcomes. Future perspectives and the implications for research and practice of using LLM-generated feedback in intelligent tutoring systems are discussed.},

We note consistencies across research perspectives that suggest a set of generalizable conclusions about the contextual factors, cognitive processes, and benefits of interventions that affect students' and teachers' motivational attitudes. Criticisms are leveled concerning the lack of theoretical guidance driving the conduct and interpretation of the majority of studies in the field. Few researchers have attempted to extend current theories of motivation in ways that are consistent with the current research on learning and classroom discourse. In particular, researchers interested in studying motivation in the content domain of school mathematics need to examine the relationship that exists between mathematics as a socially constructed field and students' desire to achieve.},

  abstract = {Research in the area of educational technology has often been critiqued for a lack of theoretical grounding. In this article we propose a conceptual framework for educational technology by building on Shulman's formulation of "pedagogical content knowledge" and extend it to the phenomenon of teachers integrating technology into their pedagogy. This framework is the result of 5 years of work on a program of research focused on teacher professional development and faculty development in higher education. It attempts to capture some of the essential qualities of teacher knowledge required for technology integration in teaching, while addressing the complex, multifaceted, and situated nature of this knowledge. We argue, briefly, that thoughtful pedagogical uses of technology require the development of a complex, situated form of knowledge that we call Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPCK). In doing so, we posit the complex roles of, and interplay among, three main components of learning environments: content, pedagogy, and technology. We argue that this model has much to offer to discussions of technology integration at multiple levels: theoretical, pedagogical, and methodological. In this article, we describe the theory behind our framework, provide examples of our teaching approach based upon the framework, and illustrate the methodological contributions that have resulted from this work.

This paper tackles the important and under-researched issue of how mathematics lessons in junior high schools can be designed to scaffold students' initial understanding of geometrical proofs. In order to scaffold the process of understanding the structure of introductory proofs, we show how flow-chart proofs with multiple solutions in `open problem' situations are a useful form of scaffold. We do this by identifying the `scaffolding functions' of flow-chart proofs with open problems through the analysis of classroom-based data from a class of Grade 8 students (aged 13--14~years old) and quantitative data from three classes. We find that using flow-chart proofs with open problems support students' development of a structural understanding of proofs by giving them a range of opportunities to connect proof assumptions with conclusions. The implication is that such scaffolds are useful to enrich students' understanding of introductory mathematical proofs.},

Students with LD are notoriously poor at self-regulation and must be taught explicitly to monitor and control their cognitive activities as they engage in academic tasks such as mathematical problem solving. This article describes intervention studies that use self-regulation strategies to improve mathematics performance of students with LD at the elementary, middle, and secondary school levels.

Specifically, immersive multimedia~environments, such as virtual reality increase the likelihood that students undergo distractions in which information seeking during system-paced instruction occurred. Although previous studies have reviewed various cue designs to yield students' higher attention, skepticism still exists regarding which ways cue designs can support their learning comprehension in video instruction. For this study, we sampled a total of 64 undergraduates in a university. Using video instruction performed by an animated pedagogical agent (APA), this study examined the effect of social (i.e., an APA's conversational gestures) and cognitive (i.e., visual cue) cues on students' learning comprehension and eye-gaze data within types of visual information (text and pictorial). Also, this study investigated how both cues promoted students' cognitive load overall. Specific to text information processing, the results of the study confirmed that the negative prime effect of social cues undermined students' learning comprehension and increased their cognitive load, whereas cognitive cues appeared to be supportive in video instruction. Also, this study found that students' different visual-attention patterns appeared in pictorial information processing. In terms of pictorial information processing, the study finding implies that whereas social cues caused visual distractions and lowered learning comprehension, cognitive cues as visual cues helped learners to integrate pictorial information via visuospatial clues. Conclusively, we reported several design implications derived from the study findings.},

Results indicated that monitoring of understanding was significantly related to pausing and restarting the video during the learning task. Additionally, participants who receive the embedded prompts in the video engaged in more SRL processes (e.g., activating prior knowledge, monitoring understanding and controlling the video). Furthermore, the embedded prompts enhanced instructional efficiency, as evidenced by the significant difference in learning outcomes and non-significant difference in mental effort.},

Diagnoseinstrumente liegen im deutschsprachigen Raum fast ausschlie{\ss}lich f{\"u}r den Grundschulbereich vor, und es fehlen Tests, die sich zum Einsatz bei {\"a}lteren Lernenden eignen. Zudem werden die auf der ICD-10 bzw. der DSM-IV basierenden Diagnose- und Klassifikationskriterien und das Diskrepanzmodell kritisch diskutiert. Diese Auseinandersetzung wird im Artikel dargestellt. Davon ausgehend wird auf die Bedeutung der verwendeten Instrumente und deren Validit{\"a}t -- insbesondere deren Inhaltsvalidit{\"a}t -- verwiesen, und es wird herausgearbeitet, welche empirischen Ergebnisse als Grundlage f{\"u}r die Auswahl von Testinhalten und Aufgaben dienen k{\"o}nnen. Einige ausgew{\"a}hlte Rechenschw{\"a}che-Tests werden hinsichtlich ihrer Begr{\"u}ndung der Validit{\"a}t untersucht. Anschlie{\ss}end wird anhand von Daten aus Basisdiagnostik Mathematik f{\"u}r die Klassen 4 -- 8 aufgezeigt, dass die Verwendung von unterschiedlich effektiven Rechenstrategien bei einfachen Kopfrechenaufgaben (z. B. Abrufen von Ergebnissen versus Abz{\"a}hlen/schriftliches Rechnen) als eigenst{\"a}ndiges Diagnosekriterium sinnvoll ist und bei der Testkonstruktion vermehrt ber{\"u}cksichtigt werden m{\"u}sste. Weiter wird dargestellt, dass die Bestimmung der Kriteriumsvalidit{\"a}t auf der Basis von Noten und Leistungseinsch{\"a}tzungen der Lehrperson fragw{\"u}rdig ist und dass im Sinne einer integralen Validierung m{\"o}glichst viele weitere Aspekte wie Intelligenz und Strategieverwendung einbezogen und insbesondere die inhaltlich-theoretische Begr{\"u}ndung der ausgew{\"a}hlten Testaufgaben als Basis der Validit{\"a}t genutzt werden m{\"u}ssen.},

It highlights the perceptions of academics and students with regard to preferences for different types of feedback, timeliness of feedback, students' engagement and interest in feedback, quality feedback and satisfaction with current practice. The findings indicate a significant discord between staff and students in relation to certain aspects of feedback practice, namely opinions on students' engagement and interest in feedback, satisfaction with current practice and feedback preference. Similarities in viewpoints were also found in relation to quality feedback.},

While the effectiveness of PF has been demonstrated for STEM learning, it has not yet been investigated whether PF is also beneficial for learning in non-STEM domains. Given this need to test PF for learning in domains other than mathematics or science, and the assumption that features embodied in a PF design are domain-independent, we investigated the effect of PF on learning social science research methods. We conducted two quasi-experimental studies with 212 and 152 10th graders. Following the paradigm of typical PF studies, we implemented two conditions: PF, in which students try to solve a complex problem prior to instruction, and Direct Instruction (DI), in which students first receive instruction followed by problem solving. In PF, students usually learn from their failure. Failing to solve a complex problem is assumed to prepare students for deeper learning from subsequent instruction. In DI, students usually learn through practice. Practicing and applying a given problem-solving procedure is assumed to help students to learn from previous instruction. In contrast to several studies demonstrating beneficial effects of PF on learning mathematics and science, in the present two studies, PF students did not outperform DI students on learning social science research methods. Thus, the findings did not replicate the PF effect on learning in a non-STEM domain. The results are discussed in light of mechanisms assumed to underlie the benefits of PF.},

  abstract = {In 2023, the US Surgeon General issued the Advisory on Social Media and Youth Mental Health, identifying critical research gaps that preclude evidence-based guidance given that most studies of social media and mental health have been cross-sectional rather than longitudinal and have focused on young adults or older adolescents rather than on younger adolescents.To evaluate longitudinal associations between social media use (time spent on social media) and depressive symptoms across 4 annual waves spanning a 3-year follow-up period from late childhood to early adolescence.In this prospective cohort study using data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study across 21 study sites from October 2016 to October 2018, children aged 9 to 10 years at baseline were assessed across 4 waves (baseline, year 1, year 2, and year 3), with year-3 follow-up through 2022. Sample sizes varied across waves and measures due to attrition and missing data. Analyses retained all available data at each wave. Data were analyzed from January 2024 to March 2025.Self-reported time spent on social media at baseline to 3-year follow-up.Reciprocal associations between social media use and depressive symptoms (Child Behavior Checklist) at baseline and at 1, 2, and 3 years of follow-up were assessed using longitudinal, cross-lagged structural equation panel models. Covariates included sex, race and ethnicity, household income, and parental educational level.At baseline, the sample included 11\,876 participants (mean [SD] age, 9.9 [0.6] years), of whom 6196 (52.2\%) were male. After adjusting for stable between-person differences and covariates, within-person increases in social media use above the person-level mean were associated with elevated depressive symptoms from year 1 to year 2 ({$\beta$}, 0.07; 95\% CI, 0.01-0.12; P\,=\,.01) and from year 2 to year 3 ({$\beta$}, 0.09; 95\% CI, 0.04-0.14; P\,\&lt;\,.001), whereas depressive symptoms were not associated with subsequent social media use at any interval. The final random-intercept cross-lagged panel model demonstrated a good fit (comparative fit index, 0.977; Tucker-Lewis index, 0.968; root mean square error of approximation, 0.031 [90\% CI, 0.029-0.033]). Between-person differences in social media use were not associated with depressive symptoms ({$\beta$}, -0.01; 95\% CI, -0.04 to 0.02; P\,=\,.46) after accounting for demographic and family-level factors.In this cohort study of 11\,876 children and adolescents, reporting higher than person-level mean social media use in years 1 and 2 after baseline was associated with greater depressive symptoms in the subsequent year. The findings suggest that clinicians should provide anticipatory guidance regarding social media use for young adolescents and their parents.},

The aim of automated grading is to approximate human level scoring. Automated Short Answer Grading (ASAG) is a subfield under automated grading, where the length of the answers ranges from a few words to a few sentences. Recently, transformer-based models have improved the state-of-the-art performance in several Natural Language Processing tasks, including ASAG. While a lot of work has focused on English language datasets, not enough attention has been paid to other languages such as German. In this study, we experiment with fine-tuned Bidirectional Encoder Representations from transformers (BERT; Devlin et al. 2018), on German ASAG datasets. We show that the BERT approach beats the bag-of-words (BOW) similarity-based approach by a substantial margin.},

We conducted full-text screening, data extraction, and risk of bias in duplicate. We calculated pooled effect sizes using multilevel random-effects meta-analysis. Searches retrieved 9,677 unique records. After screening 329 full texts, 105 met inclusion criteria, with a pooled sample of 7,776 students. Swapping video for existing teaching methods led to small improvements in student learning (g = 0.28). Adding video to existing teaching led to strong learning benefits (g = 0.80). Although results may be subject to some experimental and publication biases, they suggest that videos are unlikely to be detrimental and usually improve student learning.},

Lately, the flipped classroom model has been suggested to support this transition. However, research on the use of flipped classroom in higher education is in its infancy and little is known about student's perceptions of learning through flipped classroom. This study examined students' perceptions of flipped classroom education in a last year university course in research methods. A questionnaire was administered measuring students' (n\,=\,240) perceptions of flipped classroom in general, video as a learning tool, and Moodle (Learning Management System) as a supporting tool within the frame of a flipped classroom model. The results revealed that a large majority of the students had a positive attitude towards flipped classroom, the use of video and Moodle, and that a positive attitude towards flipped classroom was strongly correlated to perceptions of increased motivation, engagement, increased learning, and effective learning. Low achievers significantly reported more positively as compared to high achievers with regards to attitudes towards the use of video as a learning tool, perceived increased learning, and perceived more effective learning.},

Then follows a review of previous research on the role of children's academic performance, their motivation and their socio-emotional characteristics in their teachers' instruction methods and teacher--child relationships. Some of the mechanisms that may be responsible for these ``evocative impacts'' are discussed.

  abstract = {A worrying number of psychological findings are not replicable. Diagnoses of the causes of this ``replication crisis,'' and recommendations to address it, have nearly exclusively focused on methods of data collection, analysis, and reporting. We argue that a further cause of poor replicability is the often weak logical link between theories and their empirical tests. We propose a distinction between discovery-oriented and theory-testing research. In discovery-oriented research, theories do not strongly imply hypotheses by which they can be tested, but rather define a search space for the discovery of effects that would support them. Failures to find these effects do not question the theory. This endeavor necessarily engenders a high risk of Type I errors---that is, publication of findings that will not replicate. Theory-testing research, by contrast, relies on theories that strongly imply hypotheses, such that disconfirmation of the hypothesis provides evidence against the theory. Theory-testing research engenders a smaller risk of Type I errors. A strong link between theories and hypotheses is best achieved by formalizing theories as computational models. We critically revisit recommendations for addressing the ``replication crisis,'' including the proposal to distinguish exploratory from confirmatory research, and the preregistration of hypotheses and analysis plans.},

For this purpose, the linguistic features and grammatical difficulties of scientific English are reviewed and compared to the grammatical features of mathematical symbolic notation and mathematical images. From here, the integration of language, mathematics symbolism and images in mathematics texts and the nature of spoken language in mathematics classrooms and associated difficulties are explored. The approach leads to the notion of a `multimodal register' for mathematics to complement the existing language-based conceptualization of register. The multimodal approach has significant implications for teaching and learning mathematics and the development of strategies for mastering the mathematics register for the effective communication of mathematical knowledge.},

The advancement in the NLP area has helped solve problems in the domains such as Neural Machine Translation, Name Entity Recognition, Sentiment Analysis, and Chatbots, to name a few. The topic of NLP broadly consists of two main parts: the representation of the input text (raw data) into numerical format (vectors or matrix) and the design of models for processing the numerical data. This paper focuses on the former part and surveys how the NLP field has evolved from rule-based, statistical to more context-sensitive learned representations. For each embedding type, we list their representation, issues they addressed, limitations, and applications. This survey covers the history of text representations from the 1970s and onwards, from regular expressions to the latest vector representations used to encode the raw text data. It demonstrates how the NLP field progressed from where it could comprehend just bits and pieces to all the significant aspects of the text over time.},

  abstract = {In March 2020 schools in Austria temporarily closed and switched to distance learning to contain the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19). The resulting situation posed great challenges to teachers, guardians and students (Huber and Helm 2020). Research has shown that perceived competence (Deci and Ryan 2000) affects selfregulated learning (SRL), intrinsic motivation and procrastination, however few studies have considered these variables in context of distance learning among adolescents. This study investigated differences in students who perceived themselves as high vs. low in competence with respect to these constructs. In an online questionnaire, 2652~Austrian secondary school students answered closed questions regarding SRL, intrinsic motivation and procrastination as well as open-ended questions about challenges, successes and need for support in distance. Structural equation modeling was applied for the quantitative analysis which was complemented by thematic analysis for the qualitative questions (Braun and Clarke 2006). Results showed that students who experienced themselves as highly competent use SRL strategies (goal setting and planning, time management, metacognitive strategies) more often and are more intrinsically motivated than students with lower perceived competence. They also procrastinate less. Furthermore, qualitative analysis revealed that although all students face similar challenges (e.g., independent learning, time and task management, learning on the computer, lack of contact with teachers and peers), students who perceived themselves as highly competent seemed to cope better, and have less need for support. Implications for distance learning and future research are discussed.},

In order to support and identify mathematical modelling processes, Fermi problems have been used in a classroom based study with third and fourth graders. In contrast to standard word problems that frequently just require the application of one or two simple algorithms and therefore do not provide information on how to find a mathematical model, Fermi problems provide the necessary complexity for studying authentic mathematical modelling. Videotapes of small group work in a grade four classroom provided the data basis. The analysis of the classroom data suggests that word problems with a high level of complexity can be solved in sensible and appropriate ways by third and fourth graders. The Fermi problems in this context served as ``model-eliciting tasks'', because the required modelling process necessitates multiple modelling cycles with multiple ways of thinking about givens, goals, and solution paths.},

In the current study, I present cumulative exam performance and student evaluation data from two sections of a statistics course I recently taught: one a traditional lecture ( N = 19) and the other a flipped class ( N = 24). Independent samples t-tests revealed students in the flipped classroom outperformed their lecture peers by more than a letter grade on the final exam. Further, these students were more satisfied with the course overall, a novel finding in this burgeoning area of research. This latter point, I argue, is likely due to the strong cohesion between the in-class and out-of-class content.},

The bulk of the literature on typing expertise concerns highly trained professional touch-typists, but contemporary typing skills mostly result from unconstrained sustained practice. We measured the typing performance of a large cohort of 1301 university students through an online platform and followed a preregistered plan to analyse performance distributions, practice factors, and cognitive variables. The results suggest that the standard model with a sharp distinction between novice and expert typists may be inaccurate to account for the performance of the current generation of young typists. More generally, this study shows how the mere frequent use of a new tool can lead to the incidental development of high expertise.},

A recent re-analysis of one of these meta-analyses, however, supports that learning from animations is considerably more effective than learning from static pictures if the specifics of the displayed changes need to be learned. In order to further validate this finding as well as to clarify the educational strengths and weaknesses of animations and static pictures, an experimental study with three groups was conducted. Overall, 88 university students participated in the study. One group of learners (               n               \,=\,30) watched a single picture of a gear mechanism, one group of learners (               n               \,=\,28) watched four pictures, and one group of learners (               n               \,=\,30) watched an animation. All groups had to identify specific motions and spatial arrangements covered by the gear mechanism. While learners who watched the animation exhibited the best performance with respect to the identification of motions, learners who watched the pictures showed the best performance with respect to the identification of spatial arrangements. The effect sizes are large. The results of the study help to clarify when animations and when static pictures are most suitable for learning.},

Due to the availability of mobile technologies, students can access learning materials without being bound by time and place. On the grounds that these applications allow information exchange, time and space limitations such as classrooms or school bells have been eliminated. Therefore, this study aims to assess mobile-assisted seamless learning environments' effects on students' success and motivation in the secondary school 7th grade mathematics class algebra unit and student opinions about the application. The research is designed using the descriptive pattern of mixed-method research. The sample of the study is 73 middle school students (30 male and 43 female) in Turkey. Augmented Reality (AR) applications developed in teaching algebra to support individual learning and to utilize mobile technologies, WhatsApp groups were created. Algebra Achievement Test (AAT), Mathematics Motivation Scale (MMS), and semi-structured interview forms were used as data collection tools in the research. The results of the study showed that there were statistically significant differences in favor of the experiment group in AAT and MMS scores. However, no significant difference was found between the groups in intrinsic goal orientation and test anxiety scores, which are motivation sub-dimensions. The findings obtained from AAT, MMS, and the students' opinions showed that mobile technology applications used in out-of-school learning environments positively affect the learning process.},

While empirical research concerning the use of videos for educational purposes has increased, the literature lacks an overview of the specific effects of videos on diverse learning outcomes. To address such a gap, this paper presents preliminary results of a large-scale systematic review of peer-reviewed empirical studies published from 2007-2017. The study synthesizes the trends observed through the analysis of 178 papers selected from the screening of 2531 abstracts. The findings summarize the effects of manipulating video presentation, content and tasks on learning outcomes, such as recall, transfer, academic achievement, among others. The study points out the gap between large-scale analysis of fine-grained data on video interaction and experimental findings reliant on established psychological instruments. Narrowing this gap is suggested as the future direction for the research on video-based learning.},

The qualitative interview study investigates teachers' self-reported practices with respect to the underlying inclusive orientations and categories for perception and thinking. 17 teachers were interviewed, they describe and reflect their practices within the same teaching unit on percentages in Grade 7. The qualitative analysis identifies five recurring leading categories: social participation, occupation, task propensity, content participation and adaptive learning progressions; teachers change between the five. The analysis shows how the leading categories are expressed in the different jobs and practices.},

While these perspectives have sometimes been treated as competing, we emphasize the need of their integration to identify sets of principles that can inform professional development programs for quality development. This paper starts from characterizing the four perspectives, and then shows how they are iteratively intertwined in providing a research base for specifying high-quality principles for teaching, in our case exemplified for the school subject mathematics. For this goal, we present the set of five principles that we have deemed as core principles for a new nationwide, ten-year professional development program in Germany: Conceptual Focus, Cognitive Demand, Student Focus and Adaptivity, Longitudinal Coherence, and Enhanced Communication. We will discuss these five principles against their backgrounds stemming from combing normative, epistemological, empirical, and pragmatic perspectives. This set of principles serves as an exemplary case to substantiate our general argumentation that contemporary educational research and professional development activities should not choose between perspectives but strive for combining them.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

With a view of identifying the genesis and theoretical foundations of this conception, this paper reviews and discusses relevant historical sustainability literature. From this we find that there is no single point of origin of this three-pillar conception, but rather a gradual emergence from various critiques in the early academic literature of the economic status quo from both social and ecological perspectives on the one hand, and the quest to reconcile economic growth as a solution to social and ecological problems on the part of the United Nations on the other. The popular three circles diagram appears to have been first presented by Barbier (Environ Conserv 14:101, doi: 10.1017/s0376892900011449, 1987), albeit purposed towards developing nations with foci which differ from modern interpretations. The conceptualisation of three pillars seems to predate this, however. Nowhere have we found a theoretically rigorous description of the three pillars. This is thought to be in part due to the nature of the sustainability discourse arising from broadly different schools of thought historically. The absence of such a theoretically solid conception frustrates approaches towards a theoretically rigorous operationalisation of `sustainability'.},

The models were compared on four criteria (i.e. background theories, definitions of SRL, components included in the models and empirical work). The results show that theoretical background is an important differentiating feature. The two models that resembled each other more than any other two models (i.e. Pintrich and Zimmerman) were inspired by the same background theory (i.e. social cognitive theory). On the other hand, the models that differed most from the other models (i.e. Borkowski and Winne) were also theoretically the farthest removed ones.},

We examined language development and false-belief understanding in deaf learners of an emerging sign language in Nicaragua. The use of mental-state vocabulary and performance on a low-verbal false-belief task were assessed, over 2 years, in adult and adolescent users of Nicaraguan Sign Language. Results show that those adults who acquired a nascent form of the language during childhood produce few mental-state signs and fail to exhibit false-belief understanding. Furthermore, those whose language developed over the period of the study correspondingly developed in false-belief understanding. Thus, language learning, over and above social experience, drives the development of a mature theory of mind.},

Automated writing feedback systems, which are AI-based tools, are being used excessively at universities to provide students with immediate and timely written feedback; hence, reviewing, analyzing, and synthesizing the methods and results of existing studies in this regard can be considered a crucial headway. Thus, the current study aimed at meta-analyzing the previous studies relatable to the usage of AI-based feedback systems to improve the academic writing skills of university students. Consequently, 35 studies published between 2015 and 2023 were analytically summarized and grouped based on the meta-analysis guidelines established by Cooper (Management Decision 36:493--502, 1998). The results revealed numerous benefits and some challenges of utilizing this technology. It was displayed, for example, that using AI-based feedback systems can significantly improve students' academic writing skills, increase their engagement, promote self-regulation, trigger meta-cognitive writing skills, and provide personalized feedback that facilitates the learning process. Conversely, some challenges were highlighted, especially the overuse of such technologies that can lead to dependent and reliant learners, in addition to the failure of these systems to provide feedback on writings that necessitate higher-order thinking skills, meanwhile offering generic feedback that ignores individual differences. Accordingly, a model for the optimal use of such systems was suggested in the conclusions.},

This restricted form of supervision limits their generality and usability since additional labeled data is needed to specify any other visual concept. Learning directly from raw text about images is a promising alternative which leverages a much broader source of supervision. We demonstrate that the simple pre-training task of predicting which caption goes with which image is an efficient and scalable way to learn SOTA image representations from scratch on a dataset of 400 million (image, text) pairs collected from the internet. After pre-training, natural language is used to reference learned visual concepts (or describe new ones) enabling zero-shot transfer of the model to downstream tasks. We study the performance of this approach by benchmarking on over 30 different existing computer vision datasets, spanning tasks such as OCR, action recognition in videos, geo-localization, and many types of fine-grained object classification. The model transfers non-trivially to most tasks and is often competitive with a fully supervised baseline without the need for any dataset specific training. For instance, we match the accuracy of the original ResNet-50 on ImageNet zero-shot without needing to use any of the 1.28 million training examples it was trained on. We release our code and pre-trained model weights at https://github.com/OpenAI/CLIP.},

This study aims to reduce this gap by identifying the adoption challenges of AI, along with the opportunities offered, for the construction industry. To achieve the aim, the study adopts a systematic literature review approach using the PRISMA protocol. In addition, the systematic review of the literature focuses on the planning, design, and construction stages of the construction project lifecycle. The results of the review reveal that (a) AI is particularly beneficial in the planning stage as the success of construction projects depends on accurate events, risks, and cost forecasting; (b) the major opportunity in adopting AI is to reduce the time spent on repetitive tasks by using big data analytics and improving the work processes; and (c) the biggest challenge to incorporate AI on a construction site is the fragmented nature of the industry, which has resulted in issues of data acquisition and retention. The findings of the study inform a range of parties that operate in the construction industry concerning the opportunities and challenges of AI adaptability and help increase the market acceptance of AI practices.},

So, for instance, holes in the atmosphere or layers of pollutant gases in the atmosphere are commonly blamed for the greenhouse effect. In order to test whether such lay perceptions can be altered by adequate teaching material, a constructivist learning environment was devised and optimized according to the findings of instructional psychology geared to causing a cognitive conflict and conceptual change. A longitudinal pilot survey using a pretest-posttest design with intervention and a delayed posttest two months later was employed to analyze the efficacy of the constructivist learning environment compared to conventional teaching materials. A total of 41 thirteen-years-old 8th grade students participated. The results of the statistical analysis show that the intervention lead to a significant increase in knowledge and a better understanding of the principle of the greenhouse effect in the experimental group in the posttest as well as in the delayed posttest. These results are of considerable significance because none of the attempted treatments published so far have succeeded in bringing about long-term conceptual change.},

In this article we investigated if and how a workshop-based in-service teacher training can foster teachers' perceived value of digital media in mathematics education, their self-efficacy, and their anxiety towards teaching mathematics with digital tools. In an intervention study with               N               = 83 in-service teachers with varying teaching experience, we used cluster analysis based on their experience, value, self-efficacy, and anxiety               before               the intervention to determine three different teacher orientations regarding teaching mathematics with digital tools. Paired sample               t               -tests with pretest and posttest data revealed that for two of three clusters these beliefs, motivation, and emotions changed in a positive way during the intervention while for the third no change was found. Our study sheds light on the role of motivational and emotional orientations for the implementation of digital tools in mathematics education: it shows that these orientations can be utilized to cluster teachers on this topic and illustrates that these orientations can be successfully fostered---while individual differences may exist in the effect and success of interventions.},

  abstract = {Recent research has shown that learning from worked-out examples is of major importance for initial skill acquisition in well-structured domains such as mathematics. However, only those learners who actively process the presented examples profit noticeably from this learning mode. Specifically, the learning outcomes depend on how well the learners explain the solution steps presented in the examples to themselves (`self-explanation effect''). In a series of studies on learning mathematics from examples, learners' spontaneous self-explanations and instructional means used to encourage self-explanations were investigated. In this research, the following main findings were obtained. Most learners were rather passive with respect to their spontaneous self-explanations. Among the active and successful learners, two subgroups employing different self-explanation styles could be identified. With regard to the instructional means used to induce effective example processing, it turned out that to employ ``learning by teaching'' in order to stimulate explanation activities was of very limited use. Attempts to directly train for or elicit certain types of self-explanations were more successful. However, even in the latter case, self-explanations had inherent deficits (e.g., proneness to errors). Thus, we sought to design learning arrangements that try to integrate self-explanations with well-timed and well-adapted instructional explanations (e.g., from tutors) in order to enhance students' problem-solving skills.},

It also presents the results from the analyses and the reliability and validity evidence. Two tables summarize the construct validity data and the criterion-related data on teacher judgment measures. Part 2 provides instructions for administering and interpreting the SRBCSS-R and describes purposes for using the scales, guidelines for using the scales correctly, a teacher training exercise, and how to establish local norms. Five appendices include: the second field test version of the SRBCSS-R, a brief scale for rating student performance in a gifted program, a sample SRBCSS-R, the full teacher-training exercise for using the SRBCSS-R, guidelines for calculating local percentile rank norms, and an article, "A Practical System for Identifying Gifted and Talented Students" by Joseph S.

Against this background, the article addresses the implications of competence-oriented instruction for actual (subject-specific) teaching practice, and pursues the questions pertaining to the role of teachers as diagnosticians and creators of learning settings.},

  abstract = {Mit der Benennung eines Kompetenzbereichs Kommunikation in den Bildungsstandards werden Alltags- und Fachsprache zu einem Gegenstand des Unterrichts. Eine allgemeine Unterscheidung der beiden Sprachebenen f{\"a}llt jedoch schwer, sodass zun{\"a}chst unklar bleibt, wie das Anliegen der Standards umgesetzt werden kann. Ein {\"U}berblick {\"u}ber die Diskussion zur Rolle der Sprache im Naturwissenschaftsunterricht offenbart zudem sehr unterschiedliche Blickrichtungen. Im vorliegenden Beitrag wird ein ordnender Rahmen gew{\"a}hlt, indem eine auf die Struktur des Gegenstands gerichtete Perspektive von einer solchen unterschieden wird, die nach Entwicklungsverl{\"a}ufen fragt. In Zusammenhang mit letzterer Blickrichtung werden die Ergebnisse einer empirischen Untersuchung vorgestellt und in zwei unterschiedlichen Interpretationsrahmen gedeutet, einem fachlich-fachdidaktischen und einem, der auf Ergebnisse der Sprachentwicklungsforschung rekurriert. Es wird daf{\"u}r argumentiert, Alltags- und Fachsprache nicht als einander gegen{\"u}ber stehende Gebilde anzusehen, wobei die Fachsprache aus einer Pflege der Alltagssprache zu entwickeln sei. Stattdessen wird daf{\"u}r argumentiert, Alltags- und Fachsprache als je f{\"u}r sich entwicklungsf{\"a}hig anzusehen und im Unterricht zu thematisieren. (Autorenreferat).;;;In national science education standards students' communication and use of special or everyday language play an important role. Literature concerning everyday and special language in science shows that it is difficult to distinguish these language levels. In addition, a broad range of approaches exist to describe the role of everyday and special language for science education. In the present paper these different approaches are discussed within a framework distinguishing two fundamental perspectives, one concerning structurally aspects of language, the other involving the development experienced by the students. The latter is deeply discussed including empirical data. Conclusions are made regarding two different interpretations, firstly referring to students' preconceptions, secondly including results of the field of second language learning. The paper argues against the view of special language in science to be developed starting from everyday language. The data give reason for regarding everyday language and special language in science as different challenges, both to be taught and developed. (Author's abstract).},

  abstract = {The task of company classification is traditionally performed using established standards, such as the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS). However, these approaches heavily rely on laborious manual efforts by domain experts, resulting in slow, costly, and vendor-specific assignments. Therefore, we investigate recent natural language processing (NLP) advancements to automate the company classification process. In particular, we employ and evaluate various NLP-based models, including zero-shot learning, One-vs-Rest classification, multi-class classifiers, and ChatGPT-aided classification. We conduct a comprehensive comparison among these models to assess their effectiveness in the company classification task. The evaluation uses the Wharton Research Data Services (WRDS) dataset, consisting of textual descriptions of publicly traded companies. Our findings reveal that the RoBERTa and One-vs-Rest classifiers surpass the other methods, achieving F1 scores of 0.81 and 0.80 on the WRDS dataset, respectively. These results demonstrate that deep learning algorithms offer the potential to automate, standardize, and continuously update classification systems in an efficient and cost-effective way. In addition, we introduce several improvements to the multi-class classification techniques: (1) in the zero-shot methodology, we use TF-IDF to enhance sector representation, yielding improved accuracy in comparison to standard zero-shot classifiers; (2) next, we use ChatGPT for dataset generation, revealing potential in scenarios where datasets of company descriptions are lacking; and (3) we also employ K-Fold to reduce noise in the WRDS dataset, followed by conducting experiments to assess the impact of noise reduction on the company classification results.},

In response, the current study investigated the associations between these variables with a sample of 206 university students in the context of a two-semester math course. Self-efficacy measured after one semester (t2) was positively related to both cognitive and metacognitive strategy use at the beginning (t1) and the end of the math course (t3). The use of either strategy was stable from t1 to t3. Once the variance overlap between the learning strategies was controlled for, metacognitive strategy use at t1 was positively and at t3 negatively associated with performance in the math course exam at t4. Greater levels of self-efficacy at t2 also predicted a better exam performance. Future longitudinal research is warranted to demonstrate the causal role of self-efficacy as a mediator between learning strategy use on math performance. In terms of implications, interventions may help to foster the students' awareness for an integrated use of cognitive and metacognitive strategies.},

Overall, associations of both positive and negative relationships with engagement were medium to large, whereas associations with achievement were small to medium. Some of these associations were weaker, but still statistically significant, after correction for methodological biases. Overall, stronger effects were found in the higher grades. Nevertheless, the effects of negative relationships were stronger in primary than in secondary school.},

Our analysis shows how this shared conceptual space is constructed through the external mediational framework of shared language, situation and activity. This approach has particular implications for understanding how the benefits of collaboration are realised and serves to clarify the possible roles of the computers in supporting collaborative learning.},

Results showed small to large significant positive correlations. The strength of the evidence is limited by the small number of studies and the variability found in measures.

  abstract = {Abstract             In the perspective of self-determination theory the central aim of education should be that of enhancing students' flourishing. Flourishing involves not only the development of cognitive capacities but also capacities for agency, prosocial relationships, and psychological wellness. Strong evidence within self-determination theory, reviewed herein, shows how teaching styles that support students' basic needs for autonomy, relatedness, and competence foster these aspects of flourishing, enhancing the quality of students' engagement, learning, and social relationships. Also highlighted are how students' motivation and agency reciprocally influence teachers' tendency to be need supportive, such that interventions on both sides of the teacher-student relationship can enhance learning climates. Nonetheless, this body of evidence concerns optimizing need supports within existing school environments, which too often remain mired in policies, practices, and omnipresent evaluations that are not designed for student flourishing, and which instead often harm both students' and teachers' well-being and motivation. The chapter's conclusion includes a call to broaden the criteria by which schools are evaluated to include process as well as outcome targets. Creating the best schools we can imagine entails the assessment and cultivation of what really matters (i.e., process targets) to student flourishing in both their present and future lives.},

  abstract = {The advance of video technology in education has been accelerated due to the wide use of portable devices, the increase in the number of Internet users and massive online open courses. Online-learning videos, due to their various positive effects, are becoming increasingly acceptable for both successful students and teachers. In addition to supporting students in learning, video-based learning has proven to be a powerful reflection tool for teachers, but also significant in the context of their professional development. This study aims to analyze published work on the video-based learning to assist teachers and other educational professionals in widening their understanding of the educational benefits of the video-based learning. Also, this analysis provides video-based learning possibilities that can improve teacher/student learning and the overall quality of the classroom experience. There were 39 peer reviewed papers selected in this review and categorized into three main dimensions, namely, student learning outcomes, teachers' reflections and feedback and teachers' professional development. We review and explore past research on video-based learning in order to guide us through future studies and sketch the research status and directions.},

PF increases learning, but less is known about student emotions and collaboration during PF, particularly in a computer science context. To provide insight on students' emotions and reasoning during PF activities and their relation to performance. We conducted a PF study (N = 48) with a programming problem. We used a mixed-methods approach to analyze students' emotions, reasoning, and pretest/posttest performance. Uncertainty occurred frequently compared to confusion, frustration, and positive affect. The constructive contributions made during problem solving correlated positively with posttest scores. Although students failed to produce a correct solution, there were few instances of frustration and a promising amount of constructive reasoning during collaboration. This, coupled with prior work showing that PF improves learning over standard instruction, indicates that PF is a promising approach for computer science education.},

  abstract = {The addictive use of digital games (problematic gaming [PG]) is a phenomenon with rising prevalence, especially in adolescents. The period of adolescence is characterized by intense brain maturation processes and increased vulnerability for mental disorders. However, no recent systematic review on functional and structural neural correlates of PG is available exclusively for this age group. This paper aimed to close this gap by describing neuroimaging findings and derive clinical implications. A systematic literature search was performed via PubMed, PsycInfo, and PSYNDEX including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies on structural and functional changes in problematic gamers under 20 years of age until December 2020. The findings suggest especially prefrontal brain areas (important for cognitive control functions) but also temporoparietal regions (associated with attention processes and self-concepts), as well as frontolimbic and subcortical regions (connected to emotion regulation and reward processing) to be significantly altered in adolescents with PG compared with healthy controls. Reduced interhemispheric connectivity and altered network activity further support theories of neurofunctional imbalance as well as structural deficits to explain addictive behaviours. Based on these findings, interventions should specifically address executive and cognitive-affective deficits together with adolescent-specific developmental tasks such as personality formation. Methodological limitations including heterogeneous PG classifications need to be considered. Additional neuroimaging studies on PG based on the DSM-5 or ICD-11 framework for the (Internet) gaming disorder in adolescents with larger sample sizes and prospective designs are highly warranted to understand potential causality and to generate valid and reproducible results.},

Research on pedagogical practices supports developing mathematics knowledge through attention to the way language is used, suggesting strategies for moving students from informal, everyday ways of talking about mathematics into the registers that construe more technical and precise meanings.},

  abstract = {This is a study of two populations of learners/teachers: Pre-service teacher students (i.e., formal education for teaching certification) and In-service teachers (i.e., engaged in professional development), and involves an examination of their use of internet-based instructional applications. In these studies, the technologies are: a) Online Learning [OL]; b) Blended Learning [BL] and c) Flipped Classrooms [FC]. Treatments were compared to standard face-to-face classroom instruction (CI) on three dependent measures analysed separately to produce 77 achievement measures in the first meta-analysis, 21 attitude/satisfaction measures in the second, and 22 studies of self-efficacy in the third. Achievement data yielded a statistically significant, moderate effect size (i.e., g+= 0.44) in favor of the combined OL, BL and FC approaches versus CI, although OL showed only a small positive effect versus CI. Attitude yielded a non-significant effect size comparing CI with technology-supported strategies (g+= 0.12). Interestingly, self-efficacy produced a significant and moderate average random effect size of g+~=~0.45. Perhaps the most impactful finding of this analysis is related to improved performance of BL/FC when contrasted with OL, yielding significantly positive differences in all three measures. This confirms that improved outcomes are the result of better pedagogy, not the mere presence of technology. Finally, self-efficacy was found to be meaningfully improved when using BL/FC. This is the first meta-analysis with this target population implicating self-efficacy. These two outcomes offer important implications for institutions regarding the future design of instructional delivery for both pre- and in-service teachers.},

  abstract = {Cognitive load theory has been very influential in educational psychology during the last decade in providing guidelines for instructional design. Whereas numerous empirical studies have used it as a theoretical framework, a closer analysis reveals some fundamental conceptual problems within the theory. Various generalizations of empirical findings become questionable because the theory allows different and contradicting possibilities to explain some empirical results. The article investigates these theoretical problems by analyzing the conceptual distinctions between different kinds of cognitive load. It emphasizes that reduction of cognitive load can sometimes impair learning rather than enhancing it. Cognitive load theory is reconsidered both from the perspective of Vygotski's concept of the zone of proximal development and from the perspective of research on implicit learning. Task performance and learning are considered as related, but nevertheless fundamentally different processes. Conclusions are drawn for the further development of the theory as well as for empirical research and instructional practice.},

In the present article, this Power Approach (which in practice usually consists of testing the hypothesis of no difference at level 0.05 and requiring an estimated power of 0.80) is compared to another statistical approach, the Two One-Sided Tests Procedure, which leads to the same conclusion as the approach proposed by Westlake (2) based on the usual (shortest) 1--2{$\alpha$} confidence interval for the true average difference. It is found that for the specific choice of {$\alpha$}=0.05 as the nominal level of the one-sided tests, the two one-sided tests procedure has uniformly superior properties to the power approach in most cases. The only cases where the power approach has superior properties when the true averages are equivalent correspond to cases where the chance of concluding equivalence with the power approach when the true averages are notequivalent exceeds 0.05. With appropriate choice of the nominal level of significance of the one-sided tests, the two one-sided tests procedure always has uniformly superior properties to the power approach. The two one-sided tests procedure is compared to the procedure proposed by Hauck and Anderson (1).},

Second, we summarize major theories in the field (the control-value theory of achievement emotions, expectancy-value theory of achievement-related motivation, self-determination theory of human motivation, and social-cognitive theory of self-efficacy). Third, we present an overview of instructional characteristics that have been shown to foster emotions and motivation. Fourth, we provide an overview of the contributions to the special issue on ``Emotions and Motivation in Mathematics Education and Educational Psychology.'' Finally, we suggest directions for future research in the field with respect to advancing theory, improving measurement, and considering diversity and inclusion.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a systematic literature review of the state-of-the-art of research on learning dashboards in the fields of Learning Analytics and Educational Data Mining. Research on learning dashboards aims to identify what data is meaningful to different stakeholders and how data can be presented to support sense-making processes. Learning dashboards are becoming popular due to the increased use of educational technologies, such as Learning Management Systems (LMS) and Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). The initial search of five main academic databases and GScholar resulted in 346 papers out of which 55 papers were included in the final analysis. Our review distinguishes different kinds of research studies as well as various aspects of learning dashboards and their maturity regarding evaluation. As the research field is still relatively young, most studies are exploratory and proof-of-concept. The review concludes by offering a definition for learning dashboards and by outlining open issues and future lines of work in the area of learning dashboards. There is a need for longitudinal research in authentic settings and studies that systematically compare different dashboard designs.},

The article takes a sociotechnical perspective --- positioning learning analytics as shaped by a range of social, cultural, political, and economic factors. In this manner, various concerns are outlined regarding the propensity of learning analytics to entrench and deepen the status quo, disempower and disenfranchise vulnerable groups, and further subjugate public education to the profit-led machinations of the burgeoning ``data economy.'' In light of these charges, the article briefly considers some possible areas of change. These include the design of analytics applications that are more open and accessible, that offer genuine control and oversight to users, and that better reflect students' lived reality. The article also considers ways of rethinking the political economy of the learning analytics industry. Above all, learning analytics researchers need to begin talking more openly about the values and politics of data-driven analytics technologies as they are implemented along mass lines throughout school and university contexts.},

This difference in citation does not change after the publication of the failure to replicate. Only 12\% of postreplication citations of nonreplicable findings acknowledge the replication failure. Existing evidence also shows that experts predict well which papers will be replicated. Given this prediction, why are nonreplicable papers accepted for publication in the first place? A possible answer is that the review team faces a trade-off. When the results are more ``interesting,'' they apply lower standards regarding their reproducibility.},

The present study aimed at providing a comprehensive state-of-the-art review of AWF. Using Scopus as the main database, we identified 83 SSCI-indexed published articles on AWF (1993--2022). We investigated several main domains consisting of research contexts, AWF systems, feedback focus, ways of utilizing AWF, research design, foci of investigation, and results. Our results showed that although AWF was primarily studied in language and writing classes at the tertiary level, with a focus on English as the target language, the scope of AWF research has been steadily broadening to include diverse language environments and ecological settings. This heterogeneity was also demonstrated by the wide range of AWF systems employed (n = 31), ways of integrating AWF (n = 14), different types of AWF examined (n = 3), as well as varied research designs. In addition, three main foci of investigation were delineated: (1) the performance of AWF; (2) perceptions, uses, engagement with AWF, and influencing factors; and (3) the impact of AWF. We identified positive, negative, neutral, and mixed results in all three main foci of investigation. Overall, less positive results were found in validating AWF compared to results favoring the other two areas. Lastly, we grounded our findings within the argument-based validity framework and also examined the potential implications.},

  abstract = {Lee S. Shulman builds his foundation for teaching reform on an idea of teaching that emphasizes comprehension and reasoning, transformation and reflection. "This emphasis is justified," he writes, "by the resoluteness with which research and policy have so blatantly ignored those aspects of teaching in the past." To articulate and justify this conception, Shulman responds to four questions: What are the sources of the knowledge base for teaching?In what terms can these sources be conceptualized? What are the processes of pedagogical reasoning and action? and What are the implications for teaching policy and educational reform? The answers --- informed by philosophy, psychology, and a growing body of casework based on young and experienced practitioners --- go far beyond current reform assumptions and initiatives. The outcome for educational practitioners, scholars, and policymakers is a major redirection in how teaching is to be understood and teachers are to be trained and evaluated.

Noting that there is a passionate debate about the design of initial learning, we report evidence from a meta-analysis of 53 studies with 166 comparisons that compared PS-I with I-PS design. Our results showed a significant, moderate effect in favor of PS-I (Hedge's g 0.36 [95\% confidence interval 0.20; 0.51]). The effects were even stronger (Hedge's g ranging between 0.37 and 0.58) when PS-I was implemented with high fidelity to the principles of Productive Failure (PF), a subset variant of PS-I design. Students' grade level, intervention time span, and its (quasi-)experimental nature contributed to the efficacy of PS-I over I-PS designs. Contrasting trends were, however, observed for younger age learners (second to fifth graders) and for the learning of domain-general skills, for which effect sizes favored I-PS. Overall, an estimation of true effect sizes after accounting for publication bias suggested a strong effect size favoring PS-I (Hedge's g 0.87).},

  abstract = {Proving geometric theorems constitutes a hallmark of visual reasoning combining both intuitive and logical skills. Therefore, automated theorem proving of Olympiad-level geometry problems is considered a notable milestone in human-level automated reasoning. The introduction of AlphaGeometry, a neuro-symbolic model trained with 100 million synthetic samples, marked a major breakthrough. It solved 25 of 30 International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) problems whereas the reported baseline based on Wu's method solved only ten. In this note, we revisit the IMO-AG-30 Challenge introduced with AlphaGeometry, and find that Wu's method is surprisingly strong. Wu's method alone can solve 15 problems, and some of them are not solved by any of the other methods. This leads to two key findings: (i) Combining Wu's method with the classic synthetic methods of deductive databases and angle, ratio, and distance chasing solves 21 out of 30 methods by just using a CPU-only laptop with a time limit of 5 minutes per problem. Essentially, this classic method solves just 4 problems less than AlphaGeometry and establishes the first fully symbolic baseline strong enough to rival the performance of an IMO silver medalist. (ii) Wu's method even solves 2 of the 5 problems that AlphaGeometry failed to solve. Thus, by combining AlphaGeometry with Wu's method we set a new state-of-the-art for automated theorem proving on IMO-AG-30, solving 27 out of 30 problems, the first AI method which outperforms an IMO gold medalist.},

This review examines the current state of research on self-regulated learning and gaps in the field's understanding of how adults regulate their learning of work-related knowledge and skills. Self-regulation theory was used as a conceptual lens for deriving a heuristic framework of 16 fundamental constructs that constitute self-regulated learning. Meta-analytic findings (k = 430, N = 90,380) support theoretical propositions that self-regulation constructs are interrelated---30\% of the corrected correlations among constructs were .50 or greater. Goal level, persistence, effort, and self-efficacy were the self-regulation constructs with the strongest effects on learning. Together these constructs accounted for 17\% of the variance in learning, after controlling for cognitive ability and pretraining knowledge. However, 4 self-regulatory processes---planning, monitoring, help seeking, and emotion control---did not exhibit significant relationships with learning. Thus, a parsimonious framework of the self-regulated learning domain is presented that focuses on a subset of self-regulatory processes that have both limited overlap with other core processes and meaningful effects on learning. Research is needed to advance the field's understanding of how adults regulate their learning in an increasingly complex and knowledge-centric work environment. Such investigations should capture the dynamic nature of self-regulated learning, address the role of self-regulation in informal learning, and investigate how trainees regulate their transfer of training.

Monitoring the learning process allows learners to recognize the situations that require a need to change, revise, or optimize the current learning process. This can be done through adapting their strategies, task perception, goals, or standards for monitoring their progress. This process is called small-scale adaptation. It is not yet clear how shared monitoring in groups activates small-scale adaptation ``on the fly'' or how this phenomenon can be detected using multimodal data. The aim of this study is to explore how small-scale adaptation emerges during collaboration. Video and heart rate data were collected from four groups of three high-school students (age 16--17) who worked together during six 75-min advanced physics lessons. The results show small-scale adaptation occurs most often when groups switch from enacting tasks to defining them. Physiological synchrony occurred throughout the collaboration and was not significantly more prevalent before or after adaptation occurred. The opportunities and challenges of combining video observation to identify monitoring and adaptation events, and physiological synchrony as a possible indicator of ``sharedness,'' are discussed, contributing to the literature about using multimodal data to study learning processes.},

However, there is a need for more precise understanding of the ingredients for student satisfaction in a flipped setting. The aim of this paper was to investigate university students' experiences of the factors that create a successful flipped course. Ten measures were used to investigate the hypothesized factors affecting satisfaction, which were chosen based on the results from previous flipped classroom studies and higher educational research. These measures were grouped into three dimensions: (1) pedagogical (five measures), (2) social (three measures), and (3) technological (two measures). Exploratory factor analysis was run to analyze the adequacy of the instruments. Results revealed that the factor structure was as expected and that the instruments measuring all ten factors of teaching and learning in a flipped classroom were adequate. Furthermore, confirmatory factor analysis was used to formally operationalize the hypothesized latent constructs, and to build a structural equation model for predicting the student satisfaction of a flipped classroom. In the end, seven factors were found to predict student satisfaction with flipped courses. The highest predictor was guidance from the dimension of pedagogy, and the second-best predictor was experienced teaching for understanding. The results, limitations, and conclusion are discussed in terms of key issues and the development of a flipped classroom pedagogical design for higher education.},

Two Grade Six classes participated in a project-based learning of ``Plant Adaptations''. In Class 1 with 27 students, the project-based learning was conducted with PF instructional design; in Class 2 with 26 students, the project-based learning was conducted without PF instructional design. The learning activities spanned across farm, class, home and online spaces supported by mobile devices. Data collection includes various students' created artifacts in groups in the inquiry process, student reflections, student focus group interviews and pre- and post-domain tests. Both qualitative and quantitative data analysis methods were employed. The research findings show that compared to Class 2, the students in Class 1 gained deeper understanding of conceptual knowledge and produced better group artifacts in collaborative problem-solving quality than those in Class 2; and the students in Class 1 were more positive in facing the challenges in their project-based learning process, and developed a sense of ownership of their learning. The findings imply that PF instructional design is conducive to developing primary students' collaborative solving competency in science learning in a seamless learning environment.},

To accelerate sampling, we present denoising diffusion implicit models (DDIMs), a more efficient class of iterative implicit probabilistic models with the same training procedure as DDPMs. In DDPMs, the generative process is defined as the reverse of a Markovian diffusion process. We construct a class of non-Markovian diffusion processes that lead to the same training objective, but whose reverse process can be much faster to sample from. We empirically demonstrate that DDIMs can produce high quality samples \$10 {\textbackslash}times\$ to \$50 {\textbackslash}times\$ faster in terms of wall-clock time compared to DDPMs, allow us to trade off computation for sample quality, and can perform semantically meaningful image interpolation directly in the latent space.},

  abstract = {Zusammenfassung                            Im vorliegenden Beitrag werden basierend auf einem Evaluationsprojekt im Rahmen des von Bund und L{\"a}ndern gef{\"o}rderten Programms ,,Bildung durch Sprache und Schrift`` (BiSS) Analysen zu Bedingungen einer wirksamen Implementation von evidenzbasierten Lesef{\"o}rderma{\ss}nahmen in den schulischen Alltag am Beispiel zweier BiSS-Verb{\"u}nde und einer Kontrollgruppe vorgestellt. Sowohl hinsichtlich der Implementationsstrategie (top-down vs. bottom-up) als auch im Hinblick auf das F{\"o}rdermaterial (einfach vs. komplex) unterschieden sich die beiden F{\"o}rderma{\ss}nahmen deutlich voneinander. Zur Evaluation der Implementation kamen Lehrkr{\"a}ftebefragungen und Kompetenztestungen von Sch{\"u}ler*innen zum Einsatz. Zwei Stichproben von 100 bzw. 98~Lehrkr{\"a}ften wurden zu Begleitfaktoren der Lesef{\"o}rderung (Einstellungen, Selbstwirksamkeit, Wissen, Akzeptanz) und gew{\"u}nschten Effekten (Wiedergabetreue, Nutzung) befragt. Im Rahmen einer L{\"a}ngsschnittuntersuchung an einer Stichprobe von               N               \,=\,1054 Sch{\"u}ler*innen wurden Entwicklungen wesentlicher Facetten der Lesekompetenz (Leseverst{\"a}ndnis, Lesefl{\"u}ssigkeit, Lesestrategien, Lesemotivation) betrachtet. Die Ergebnisse zeigen zun{\"a}chst, dass eine breite Nutzung und positive Effekte in den beteiligten Verb{\"u}nden nicht in dem gew{\"u}nschten Ma{\ss}e resultieren. Dabei liegen zwischen den beiden Verb{\"u}nden --~trotz der unterschiedlichen F{\"o}rderma{\ss}nahmen~-- nur marginale Unterschiede vor. Analysen der Interkorrelationsmuster zu den Implementationsmerkmalen weisen darauf hin, dass eine erfolgreiche Implementation letztlich von einer hohen Passung zwischen Merkmalen auf Seiten der Ma{\ss}nahme, der Lehrkraft und der schulischen Rahmenbedingungen abh{\"a}ngt. Implikationen f{\"u}r Forschung und Praxis werden abgeleitet.                        ,              Abstract                            Based on an evaluation project as part of the program ``Bildung durch Sprache und Schrift'' (BiSS) funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research, this study examines preconditions of effective implementation of reading skill promotion into school practice within two BiSS-groups and one control group. The two programs largely differed with respect to their implementation strategy (top-down vs. bottom-up) and complexity of the teaching material. We used teacher surveys and competence tests for students to evaluate the two programs. Two samples of 100 and 98~teachers were surveyed regarding preconditions (beliefs, self-efficacy, knowledge, acceptance) and regarding desired effects (fidelity, usage of materials). Development of students' reading skills (reading fluency, reading comprehension, reading strategies, reading motivation) was investigated in a~longitudinal study with               N               \,=\,1054 students. Results reveal few usage and positive effects within the BiSS-groups than intended. Rather, contrasts between the results for the two programs are marginal despite their conceptual differences. Analyses of intercorrelations between aspects of implementation demonstrate that successful implementation depends on the fit of characteristics of the program, the individual teacher, and specific circumstances of the school. Implications for research and practice are discussed.},

  abstract = {The field of Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED) focuses on the intersection of technology, education, and psychology, placing a strong emphasis on supporting learners' needs with compassion and understanding. The growing prominence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to the development of scalable solutions within educational settings, including generating different types of feedback in Intelligent Tutoring Systems. However, the approach to utilizing these models often involves directly formulating prompts to solicit specific information, lacking a solid theoretical foundation for prompt construction and empirical assessments of their impact on learning. This work advocates careful and caring AIED research by going through previous research on feedback generation in ITS, with emphasis on the theoretical frameworks they utilized and the efficacy of the corresponding design in empirical evaluations, and then suggesting opportunities to apply these evidence-based principles to the design, experiment, and evaluation phases of LLM-based feedback generation. The main contributions of this paper include: an avocation of applying more cautious, theoretically grounded methods in feedback generation in the era of generative AI; and practical suggestions on theory and evidence-based feedback design for LLM-powered ITS.},

Studies demonstrate that productive failure prepares students for later learning of new, related knowledge. Our study explored the effectiveness of productive failure as an instructional intervention in health professions education with respect to (a) acquisition and application of a novel concept, and (b) learners' preparation for future learning of new, related content. Forty year-one students enrolled in the Doctor of Pharmacy program at the University of Toronto were randomly assigned to a productive failure (i.e. attempt to generate solutions before receiving instruction) or direct instruction only learning condition. After a practice phase, participants completed a series of tests designed to measure knowledge acquisition, knowledge application, and preparation for future learning (new learning is required for successful problem solving). As expected, no difference in performance was seen between participants on the acquisition and application tests. However, participants in the productive failure condition outperformed those in the direct instruction condition on the preparation for future learning test. These results emphasize the role of struggle in learning and support the theory that engaging students in solving problems that are beyond their abilities can be a productive exercise in failure. The results suggest that productive failure assists learners in acquiring the conceptual knowledge needed to facilitate learning in the future.},

  abstract = {The objective of an assessment in competence based-knowledge space theory (Cb-KST) is to infer the skills of an individual from her responses to a subset of problems. A major issue in this approach is the lack of a one-to-one correspondence between the competence states and performance states. The assessment is possible, but it cannotgo beyond an approximation. The problem becomes even more serious if Cb-KST is used for the assessment of learning, since changes caused at the competence level may not be represented by changes at the performance level. The consequence is that there could be no way for establishing whether learning has occurred or not. This impasse can be resolved for the class of conjunctive skill functions by pretending that the competence space induced by the skill function is well-graded. Under this condition an individual can make tangible progresses along the performance structure by learning one skill at a time, until full mastery is eventually reached. If the competence structure is a space satisfying certain compatibility conditions and the skill function satisfies a special property, called exclusiveness, then well-gradedness can be assured. A test of exclusiveness of a conjunctive skill function is described and exemplified.},

Paradoxically, the sex differences in the magnitude of relative academic strengths and pursuit of STEM degrees rose with increases in national gender equality. The gap between boys' science achievement and girls' reading achievement relative to their mean academic performance was near universal. These sex differences in academic strengths and attitudes toward science correlated with the STEM graduation gap. A mediation analysis suggested that life-quality pressures in less gender-equal countries promote girls' and women's engagement with STEM subjects.},

  abstract = {The knowledge required to solve algebra manipulation problems and procedures designed to hasten knowledge acquisition were studied in a series of five experiments. It was hypothesized that, as occurs in other domains, algebra problem-solving skill requires a large number of schemas and that schema acquisition is retarded by conventional problem-solving search techniques. Experiment 1, using Year 9, Year 11, and university mathematics students, found that the more experienced students had a better cognitive representation of algebraic equations than less experienced students as measured by their ability to (a) recall equations, and (b) distinguish between perceptually similar equations on the basis of solution mode. Experiments 2 through 5 studied the use of worked examples as a means of facilitating the acquisition of knowledge needed for effective problem solving. It was found that not only did worked examples, as expected, require considerably less time to process than conventional problems, but that subsequent problems similar to the initial ones also were solved more rapidly. Furthermore, decreased solution time was accompanied by a decrease in the number of mathematical errors. Both of these findings were specific to problems identical in structure to the initial ones. It was concluded that for novice problem solvers, general algebra rules are reflected in only a limited number of schemas. Abstraction of general rules from schemas may occur only with considerable practice and exposure to a wider range of schemas.},

  abstract = {Cognitive load theory has been designed to provide guidelines intended to assist in the presentation of information in a manner that encourages learner activities that optimize intellectual performance. The theory assumes a limited capacity working memory that includes partially independent subcomponents to deal with auditory/verbal material and visual/2- or 3-dimensional information as well as an effectively unlimited long-term memory, holding schemas that vary in their degree of automation. These structures and functions of human cognitive architecture have been used to design a variety of novel instructional procedures based on the assumption that working memory load should be reduced and schema construction encouraged. This paper reviews the theory and the instructional designs generated by it.},

  abstract = {Cognitive load theory uses evolutionary theory to consider human cognitive architecture and uses that architecture to devise novel, instructional procedures. The theory assumes that knowledge can be divided into biologically primary knowledge that we have evolved to acquire and biologically secondary knowledge that is important for cultural reasons. Secondary knowledge, unlike primary knowledge, is the subject of instruction. It is processed in a manner that is analogous to the manner in which biological evolution processes information. When dealing with secondary knowledge, human cognition requires a very large information store, the contents of which are acquired largely by obtaining information from other information stores. Novel information is generated by a random generate and test procedure with only very limited amounts of novel information able to be processed at any given time. In contrast, very large amounts of organized information stored in the information store can be processed in order to generate complex action. This architecture has been used to generate instructional procedures, summarized in this chapter.},

  abstract = {Cognitive load theory was introduced in the 1980s as an instructional design theory based on several uncontroversial aspects of human cognitive architecture. Our knowledge of many of the characteristics of working memory, long-term memory and the relations between them had been well-established for many decades prior to the introduction of the theory. Curiously, this knowledge had had a limited impact on the field of instructional design with most instructional design recommendations proceeding as though working memory and long-term memory did not exist. In contrast, cognitive load theory emphasised that all novel information first is processed by a capacity and duration limited working memory and then stored in an unlimited long-term memory for later use. Once information is stored in long-term memory, the capacity and duration limits of working memory disappear transforming our ability to function. By the late 1990s, sufficient data had been collected using the theory to warrant an extended analysis resulting in the publication of Sweller et al. (Educational Psychology Review, 10, 251--296, 1998). Extensive further theoretical and empirical work have been carried out since that time and this paper is an attempt to summarise the last 20~years of cognitive load theory and to sketch directions for future research.},

  abstract = {Cognitive load theory has been in development since the 1980s. Much of the impetus for that development has come from firstly, replication failures using randomised controlled trials and secondly, from the incorporation of other theories into cognitive load theory. Both have led to theory expansion. The immediate cause of the so-called ``replication crisis'' in psychology and other disciplines is a failure to replicate previous empirical findings. Using cognitive load theory as an example, I argue that the appearance of contradictory evidence does not necessarily derive from a failure to properly collect data. Rather, it can be caused by initially insufficiently detailed theories, with increasing detail often revealing the reason for a failure to replicate. For cognitive load theory, each failure to replicate, rather than being a negative, contributed to the further development of the theory. In addition, the theory has developed over many years by closely incorporating other theories associated with human cognitive architecture and evolutionary psychology. In this paper, I discuss some of the developmental milestones associated with cognitive load theory and how they were informed by replication failures and theory integration.},

The present article rebuts De Jong et al. (2023), in which we: 1) challenge their view of and approach to scientific methods in establishing the efficacy of different instructional approaches; 2) indicate that an underpinning theory to explain the cognitive machinery that drives inquiry-based instructional approaches is missing from their argument; and 3) address the empirical issues arising in their argument. We also highlight potential agreement with De Jong et al. (2023) on the essential role of explicit instruction and thus raise a call to the field to revise current science educational policies and standards to reflect such a role. Our agreements and disagreements advance the debate to a new focus concerning when and how inquiry-based learning and explicit instruction should be used and combined. While De Jong et al. (2023), in their theory-free paper, provided no answer to how explicit instruction and inquiry learning should be combined, we offer our suggestions based on evolutionary psychology and the expertise reversal effect from cognitive load theory.},

The present investigation represents the first systematic attempt to use a meta-analysis and controlled, longitudinal studies to examine the relations of specific types of motivation to overall academic achievement. The meta-analysis (Study 1) pointed toward a potentially important role of intrinsic motivation in predicting school achievement. Three empirical studies of high school and college students in Canada (Studies 2 and 3) and in Sweden (Study 4) showed that intrinsic motivation was the only motivation type to be consistently positively associated with academic achievement over a one-year period, controlling for baseline achievement. Amotivation was significantly associated with lower academic achievement in Studies 3 and 4. Interestingly, intrinsic motivation was also associated with reduced amotivation in two of our studies and it was reciprocally associated with higher school achievement in another study. Overall, our findings highlight the unique importance of intrinsic motivation for the future academic success of high school and college students.},

  abstract = {Peer review at AI conferences is stressed by rapidly rising submission volumes, leading to deteriorating review quality and increased author dissatisfaction. To address these issues, we developed Review Feedback Agent, a system leveraging multiple large language models (LLMs) to improve review clarity and actionability by providing automated feedback on vague comments, content misunderstandings, and unprofessional remarks to reviewers. Implemented at ICLR 2025 as a large randomized control study, our system provided optional feedback to more than 20,000 randomly selected reviews. To ensure high-quality feedback for reviewers at this scale, we also developed a suite of automated reliability tests powered by LLMs that acted as guardrails to ensure feedback quality, with feedback only being sent to reviewers if it passed all the tests. The results show that 27\% of reviewers who received feedback updated their reviews, and over 12,000 feedback suggestions from the agent were incorporated by those reviewers. This suggests that many reviewers found the AI-generated feedback sufficiently helpful to merit updating their reviews. Incorporating AI feedback led to significantly longer reviews (an average increase of 80 words among those who updated after receiving feedback) and more informative reviews, as evaluated by blinded researchers. Moreover, reviewers who were selected to receive AI feedback were also more engaged during paper rebuttals, as seen in longer author-reviewer discussions. This work demonstrates that carefully designed LLM-generated review feedback can enhance peer review quality by making reviews more specific and actionable while increasing engagement between reviewers and authors.

The literature search revealed 49 studies (5,786 participants) that met the inclusion criteria. A three-level meta-analysis based on 251 effect sizes revealed an overall effect size of g~=~0.38. The largest effect sizes were obtained for metacognitive strategies (g~=~0.40) and resource management strategies (g~=~0.39) followed by academic performance (g~=~0.37), motivational outcomes (g~=~0.35), and cognitive strategies (g~=~0.32). Training effects varied for specific self-regulated learning strategies and ranged between 0.23 (rehearsal) and 0.61 (attention and concentration). Moderator analyses revealed differential training effects depending on course design characteristics: Feedback predicted larger training effects for metacognitive and resource management strategies as well as motivation. Cooperative learning arrangements predicted larger training effects for cognitive and metacognitive strategies. The provision of learning protocols predicted larger training effects for resource management strategies. Moreover, training programs based on a metacognitive theoretical background reported higher effects sizes for academic achievement compared to training programs based on cognitive theories. Further, training programs that targeted older students and students with lower prior academic achievement showed larger effect sizes for resource management strategies. To conclude, self-regulated learning training programs enhanced academic performance, self-regulated learning strategies, and motivation of university students.},

  abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate feedback, yet their impact on learning remains underexplored, especially compared to existing feedback methods. This study investigates how on-demand LLM-generated explanatory feedback influences learning in seven scenario-based tutor training lessons. Analyzing over 2,600 lesson completions from 885 tutor learners, we compare posttest performance among learners across three groups: learners who received feedback generated by gpt-3.5-turbo, those who declined it, and those without access. All groups received non-LLM corrective feedback. To address potential selection bias-where higher-performing learners may be more inclined to use LLM feedback-we applied propensity scoring. Learners with a higher predicted likelihood of engaging with LLM feedback scored significantly higher at posttest than those with lower propensity. After adjusting for this effect, two out of seven lessons showed statistically significant learning benefits from LLM feedback with standardized effect sizes of 0.28 and 0.33. These moderate effects suggest that the effectiveness of LLM feedback depends on the learners' tendency to seek support. Importantly, LLM feedback did not significantly increase completion time, and learners overwhelmingly rated it as helpful. These findings highlight LLM feedback's potential as a low-cost and scalable way to improve learning on open-ended tasks, particularly in existing systems already providing feedback without LLMs. This work contributes open datasets, LLM prompts, and rubrics to support reproducibility.},

This literature review synthesizes the latest research on agent profiles, communication structures, and decision-making processes, drawing insights from both traditional multi-agent systems and state-of-the-art MA-LLM studies. In doing so, it aims to address the lack of direct comparisons in the field, illustrating how factors like scalability, communication structure, and decision-making processes influence MA-LLM performance. By examining frequent practices and outlining current challenges, the review reveals that multi-agent approaches can yield superior results but also face elevated computational costs and under-explored challenges unique to MA-LLM.

  abstract = {Abstract             This paper surveys research and practice on enhancing peer assessment with artificial intelligence. Its objectives are to give the structure of the theoretical framework underpinning the study, synopsize a scoping review of the literature that illustrates this structure, and provide a case study which further illustrates this structure. The theoretical framework has six areas: (i) Assigning Peer Assessors, (ii) Enhancing Individual Reviews, (iii) Deriving Peer Grades/Feedback, (iv) Analyzing Student Feedback, (v) Facilitating Instructor Oversight and (vi) Peer Assessment Systems. The vast majority of the 79 papers in the review found that artificial intelligence improved peer assessment. However, the focus of many papers was on diversity in grades and feedback, fuzzy logic and the analysis of feedback with a view to equalizing its quality. Relatively few papers focused on automated assignment, automated assessment, calibration, teamwork effectiveness and automated feedback and these merit further research. This picture suggests AI is making inroads into peer assessment, but there is still a considerable way to go, particularly in the under-researched areas. The paper incorporates a case study of the RIPPLE peer-assessment tool, which harnesses student wisdom, insights from the learning sciences and AI to enable time-constrained educators to immerse their students in deep and personalized learning experiences that effectively prepare them to serve as assessors. Once trained, they use a comprehensive rubric to vet learning resources submitted by other students. They thereby create pools of high-quality learning resources which can be used to recommend personalized content to students. RIPPLE engages students in a trio of intertwined activities: creation, review and personalized practice, generating many resource types. AI-driven real-time feedback is given but students are counseled to assess whether it is accurate. Affordances and challenges for researchers and practitioners were identified.},

This study investigated the effect of teacher-created computer-based video instruction (CBVI) using iPads on students' academic, behavioural and affective learning in elementary classrooms. The study used a repeated-measures design with counterbalancing to measure the effects of CBVI during mathematics lessons on student achievement scores, time on-task and attitudes towards learning. Three year three classes (n = 49) completed three lessons, each using a different mode of instruction: CBVI created by the class teacher, CBVI created by a stranger, and a traditional live lesson delivered by the class teacher. Results were analysed using a Linear Mixed Model. No significant growth in performance was detected during video instruction, however a significant growth result was achieved for the traditional live teaching mode (p {$<$} 0.001), possibly attributable to the longer duration of experimental session. Behavioural engagement was considerably higher during CBVI lessons than live lessons and students preferred their teacher's voice during CBVI. Three teachers were interviewed to examine how CBVI affected teaching and learning, with two main themes emerging: (1) positive impacts of CBVI upon students; and (2) positive impacts on teacher wellbeing. This research indicates benefits for students and teachers when using teacher-created CBVI. Further research is needed to better understand the factors that influence cognitive development of students using CBVI and to also further explore the effect of CBVI on teacher wellbeing.},

In addition, the most commonly used research methods in flipped classroom in ELT studies were found to be mixed and quantitative methods. In the examined studies, speaking and writing abilities were the most commonly studied language skills. Further analysis revealed challenges, as well as benefits related to the use of the flipped classroom method in English as a foreign language (EFL) classroom. Additionally, in studies reviewed concerning the effectiveness of the flipped classroom methods, the findings mostly pointed to the benefits of the flipped classroom method.

Efficacy was conceptualised as a bi-faceted construct consisting of personal efficacy and outcome expectancy. This research sought to establish the extent to which differences in efficacy are explained by students' mathematics attainment level prior to entry into teacher education; the educational level of the students (whether postgraduate or undergraduate); students' sense of preparedness to teach mathematics on school placement; and students' gender. A total of 186 students responded to a questionnaire designed to measure their efficacy beliefs after completing one taught mathematics education module in university and one teaching practice placement in primary schools. Bivariate and regression analysis pointed to complex relationships between the explanatory and outcome variables. On bivariate analysis, findings included statistically significant associations between gender, mathematics attainment, preparedness to teach, and one or both of personal efficacy and outcome expectancy. In the regression analysis, gender was statistically significantly associated with outcome expectancy, while preparedness to teach and mathematics attainment were statistically significantly correlated with personal efficacy. Personal efficacy and outcome expectancy were significantly correlated on bivariate analysis, but significance was not retained after controlling for other factors in the regression models. This research has implications for teacher educators in understanding factors explaining mathematics teaching efficacy and therefore helping to better prepare preservice teachers to teach mathematics in the primary school classroom.},

  abstract = {Because of overwhelming evidence of publication bias in psychology, techniques to correct meta-analytic estimates for such bias are greatly needed. The methodology on which the p-uniform and p-curve methods are based has great promise for providing accurate meta-analytic estimates in the presence of publication bias. However, in this article, we show that in some situations, p-curve behaves erratically, whereas p-uniform may yield implausible estimates of negative effect size. Moreover, we show that (and explain why) p-curve and p-uniform result in overestimation of effect size under moderate-to-large heterogeneity and may yield unpredictable bias when researchers employ p-hacking. We offer hands-on recommendations on applying and interpreting results of meta-analyses in general and p-uniform and p-curve in particular. Both methods as well as traditional methods are applied to a meta-analysis on the effect of weight on judgments of importance. We offer guidance for applying p-uniform or p-curve using R and a user-friendly web application for applying p-uniform.},

  abstract = {Flipping the classroom (FTC) is a didactical approach aimed at letting students come to class prepared and apply the learning material actively during class. As FTC places a higher demand on students' self-regulated learning (SRL) skills, our goal in the current study was to research the effects of SRL support in a flipped classroom on students' SRL (self-reports and online activities) and learning outcomes. Previous research showed that video embedded SRL prompts enhances students' SRL and learning outcomes. We measured the effects of SRL prompts with a quasi-experimental design in six flipped History classrooms in secondary education where 154 students were randomly assigned to the SRL prompts or no SRL prompt condition. We found positive effects of the SRL prompts for the completion rate of the instructional videos (i.e., students in the SRL prompts condition watched more videos), but not for other indicators of SRL or learning outcomes. Thus, in contrast to previous research from higher education, our results show that implementing SRL prompts in a flipped classroom is not directly effective in secondary education. We address potential explanations for the absence of effects of the SRL prompts for theory and practice into SRL support in flipped classrooms.},

  abstract = {As traditional handwriting is progressively being replaced by digital devices, it is essential to investigate the implications for the human brain. Brain electrical activity was recorded in 36 university students as they were handwriting visually presented words using a digital pen and typewriting the words on a keyboard. Connectivity analyses were performed on EEG data recorded with a 256-channel sensor array. When writing by hand, brain connectivity patterns were far more elaborate than when typewriting on a keyboard, as shown by widespread theta/alpha connectivity coherence patterns between network hubs and nodes in parietal and central brain regions. Existing literature indicates that connectivity patterns in these brain areas and at such frequencies are crucial for memory formation and for encoding new information and, therefore, are beneficial for learning. Our findings suggest that the spatiotemporal pattern from visual and proprioceptive information obtained through the precisely controlled hand movements when using a pen, contribute extensively to the brain's connectivity patterns that promote learning. We urge that children, from an early age, must be exposed to handwriting activities in school to establish the neuronal connectivity patterns that provide the brain with optimal conditions for learning. Although it is vital to maintain handwriting practice at school, it is also important to keep up with continuously developing technological advances. Therefore, both teachers and students should be aware of which practice has the best learning effect in what context, for example when taking lecture notes or when writing an essay.},

  abstract = {Cognitive load theory (CLT) is aimed at developing training material that efficiently makes use of the available cognitive processing capacity and stimulates the learner's ability to use acquired knowledge and skills in new situations. It is claimed that CLT-based training formats meet the cognitive abilities of elderly learners particularly well. That is, cognitive aging brings about several declines of working memory, which impede the acquisition of complex cognitive skills. By making an optimal use of the `remaining' cognitive resources, learning can be enhanced. For that purpose, CLT provides a promising range of training formats that have proven their effectiveness relative to conventional formats in young adults. This article presents an experimental study (N=54) aimed at the efficiency of worked examples as a substitute for conventional practice problems in training both elderly and young adults. According to CLT, studying worked examples is a more efficient means of training complex skills than solving conventional problems. As predicted, the results show that --- with respect to the elderly --- the efficiency of studying worked examples is higher than the efficiency of solving conventional problems in that less training time and cognitive load leads to a comparable level of performance.},

The identification, characterization, and study of basic needs has been central to the research agenda of Basic Psychological Needs Theory, one of SDT's six mini-theories. In this chapter, we provide an in-depth characterization of the nine criteria that characterize the basic needs for autonomy, relatedness, and competence: essential, psychological, pervasive, universal, inherent, distinct, content-specific, directional, and explanatory. We elaborate on the theoretical and research implications of these criteria and provide a selective review of this rapidly growing body of empirical work. We conclude that basic needs provide a universal and parsimonious framework to account for people's growth and flourishing as well as their stagnation and problem behavior, while also accounting for the growth-conducive versus toxic effects of different environments.},

The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 Englishto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.0 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature.},

The flipped classroom model refers to an instructional approach in which students watch educational videos at home and homework assignments are done in class. Effect sizes were calculated for the research designs ``post-test only'', ``pre-test-post-test (time)'' and ``pre-test-post-test with control group (treatment)''. The meta-analytical findings for the condition ``treatment'' confirm the effectiveness of flipped classroom on student achievement in comparison to traditional instruction (Cohen's d = 0.42, 95 \% CI [0.20 -- 0.63], Z = 3.81, p {$<$} .001). Moderator analyses on the effect sizes ``time'' show stronger effects for subjects in the STEM area (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) than for foreign languages and humanities. The effect sizes were also higher for shorter intervention studies than for longer ones and if quiz at home had been left out. Moderator analyses on the effect sizes ``post-test only'' and ``treatment'' make clear that the effect sizes for intervention studies without a learning management system are higher than with a learning management system. Findings are discussed in terms of their implications for educational practice.},

This essay highlights some of those cognitive biases -- from hyperbolic discounting to the problem of overchoice -- and discusses the ways in which platform design can manipulate disclosure. It then explains how current law allows this manipulative and anti-consumer behavior to continue and proposes a new approach to reign in the phenomenon.},

  abstract = {An increasing number of instructional videos online integrate a real instructor on the video screen. So far, the empirical evidence from previous studies has been limited and conflicting, and none of the studies have explored how learners' allocation of visual attention to the on-screen instructor influences learning and learner perceptions. Therefore, this study aimed to disentangle a) how instructor presence in online videos affects learning, learner perceptions (i.e., cognitive load, judgment of learning, satisfaction, situational interest), and visual attention distribution and b) to what extent visual attention patterns in instructor-present videos predict learning and learner perceptions. Sixty college students each watched two videos on Statistics, one on an easy topic and the other one on a difficult topic, with each in one of the two video formats: instructor-present or instructor-absent. Their eye movements were simultaneously registered using a desktop-mounted eye tracker. Afterwards, participants self-reported their cognitive load, judgment of learning, satisfaction, and situational interest for both videos, and feelings toward seeing the instructor for the instructor-present videos. Learning from the two videos was measured using retention and transfer questions. Findings indicated instructor presence a) improved transfer performance for the difficult topic, b) reduced cognitive load for the difficult topic, c) increased judgment of learning for the difficult topic, and d) enhanced satisfaction and situational interest for both topics. Most participants expressed a positive feeling toward the instructor. Results also showed the instructor attracted a considerable amount of overt visual attention in both videos, and the amount of attention allocated to the instructor positively predicted participants' satisfaction level for both topics.},

  abstract = {This study aimed to better understand the extent of subject specificity in students' engagement across three engagement subdimensions (emotional, behavioral, and cognitive) and over time. We assessed students' engagement in two school subjects (math and German as the language of instruction) at the beginning and end of the first year of upper secondary school (N~=~1324). The results of our longitudinal bifactorial modeling showed that the subdimensions had both subject-specific and subject-independent aspects. Emotional engagement was the most subject-specific, and behavioral engagement was the most subject-independent. Subject specificity was higher for math than German and increased over the school year. Furthermore, students' self-concept, self-efficacy beliefs, interest, and grades were more related to subject-specific than subject-independent aspects, especially in math. Our results suggest that it is essential to consider the increasing subject specificity and the variability in subject specificity across dimensions when developing strategies to strengthen students' engagement. Educational Relevance Subject-specific engagement is one of the critical factors influencing students' learning and achievement. However, little is known about how subject-specific and how general students' engagement is when they engage in a particular subject. Our study showed that subject specificity is quite high and increases over time. Our results thus encourage teachers to foster students' subject-specific engagement over and above their general tendency to engage at school -- and to increase such efforts as students grow older. Given the varying subject specificity of different engagement dimensions, teachers should know that emotional engagement may tip the scales in subject-specific interventions. Separating subject-specific and subject-independent aspects of engagement might support schools in designing more targeted interventions to tackle students' disengagement. It can help to develop strategies that will lead students to become more engaged in individual subjects.},

  abstract = {Adaptive online tasks require immediate feedback even on open questions. To get this feedback, we relied on students' self-assessment, comparing their answers with sample answers. Our aim is to replace the self-assessment with an automated grading system using NLP. For this purpose, we proposed a deep learning model based on transformers and conducted analyses on a self-curated German language dataset of nearly 7000 answers. Having introduced the attention mechanism, transformers take into account the relation between the words of a sentence. Our model comprises of two transformer encoders for student response and sample answer. The encoders take as input the pre-trained word embeddings and output new representations. By applying a simple feed forward neural network followed by a softmax to the difference between encoders' outputs we predict the grade. Our approach results in an accuracy of 60\% and outperforms the simple random classifier (25\%). Different answer styles of students compared to sample answers, spelling mistakes, synonyms, abbreviations, and other irregularities are limiting the accuracy of our model. Therefore, we plan to correct the texts for spelling errors, to create a dictionary for synonyms and abbreviation lexicon of technical words and lemmatise all words. In addition, we might change the analysis strategy by taking keywords from the sample answers and searching for them in the student answers in order to grade the answers.},

  abstract = {Background The inclusion of interesting but irrelevant elements (seductive details) in learning environments can increase students' motivation but also extraneous cognitive load. Accordingly, research mainly suggests detrimental effects on learning. However, most studies were conducted with participants who were extrinsically motivated to engage with the learning material anyway. Aims We assumed that presenting seductive details would impair learning when extrinsic motivation is high but improve learning when extrinsic motivation is low because the motivational potential that could be exploited through seductive details is greater and, thus, the motivational benefits might outweigh the cognitive disadvantages. Sample and method Two experimental studies (N~=~120; N~=~210) were conducted, which followed a 2~{\texttimes}~2 mixed design. The presence of seductive details was manipulated between subjects (with vs. without). External regulation - as one type of extrinsic motivation - was manipulated within subjects (low vs. high) by introducing the respective learning unit as either voluntary or mandatory. Results Results of both experiments showed that presenting seductive details only impaired test performance in high external regulation units but had no effect or even improved learning in low external regulation units. Additionally, in both studies, seductive details indirectly improved test performance via interest only in low external regulation units. Conclusions The results emphasize that the inclusion of seductive details should not be seen as unfavorable per se but as a trade-off between motivational advantages and cognitive disadvantages. Hence, whether seductive details impede or promote learning considerably depends on how much learners are motivated beforehand.},

  abstract = {Feedback is considered a key factor of students' effective learning. However, current empirical studies show that the effectiveness of feedback systematically depends on both the students' individual perception of feedback and their individual learning characteristics. The present study investigates how students in German language classes in upper secondary schools perceive the feedback they receive from their teachers during class and to what extent differences in the perception of feedback can be explained by the students' learning motivation. Our analyses are based on data from the FeeHe study (Feedback im Kontext von Heterogenit{\"a}t), in which 807 senior high school students were surveyed at two measurement points. We assessed different dimensions of feedback (task, process, self-regulation, and discourse dimension) and different qualities of the students' learning motivation. Using latent profile analyses, we first identified characteristic individual motivational profiles, which were then used as predictors of the students' perception of feedback. Our findings reveal three characteristic motivational profiles: (a) students with high levels of controlled forms of motivation and at the same time low levels of autonomous motivation, (b) students with high levels of both controlled and autonomous motivation simultaneously, and (c) students with high levels of controlled forms of motivation and at the same time moderate levels of autonomous forms of motivation. The results further affirm our expectation that students' perception of feedback varies systematically depending on their motivational profiles. (DIPF/Orig.)},

  abstract = {It was the belief that assessment is the driving force of curriculum that motivated the authors of this monograph to embark on a program of research and development into the use of digital technologies to support more authentic forms of assessment. They perceived that in responding to the educational needs of children in the 21st Century, curriculum needed to become more relevant and engaging, but that change was unlikely without commensurate change in methods and forms of assessment. This was particularly true for the high-stakes assessment typically conducted at the conclusion of schooling as this tended to become the focus of the implemented curriculum throughout the years of school. Therefore the authors chose to focus on this area of assessment with the understanding that this would inform assessment policy and practices generally in schools. This book provides a conceptual framework and outlines a project in which digital methods of representing students performance were developed and tested in the subject areas of Applied Information Technology, Engineering, Italian and Physical Education. The methodology and data collection processes are discussed, and the data is analysed, providing the basis for conclusions and recommendations--R{\'e}sum{\'e} de l'{\'e}diteur},

Overall results based on a random-effects model indicate a medium effect (d = 0.48) of feedback on student learning, but the significant heterogeneity in the data shows that feedback cannot be understood as a single consistent form of treatment. A moderator analysis revealed that the impact is substantially influenced by the information content conveyed. Furthermore, feedback has higher impact on cognitive and motor skills outcomes than on motivational and behavioral outcomes. We discuss these findings in the light of the assumptions made in The power of feedback (Hattie \& Timperley, 2007). In general, the results suggest that feedback has rightly become a focus of teaching research and practice. However, they also point towards the necessity of interpreting different forms of feedback as independent measures.},

  abstract = {Human cognition is distinguished by our ability to adapt to different environments and circumstances. Yet the mechanisms driving adaptive behavior have predominantly been studied in separate asocial and social contexts, with an integrated framework remaining elusive. Here, we use a collective foraging task in a virtual Minecraft environment to integrate these two fields, by leveraging automated transcriptions of visual field data combined with high-resolution spatial trajectories. Our behavioral analyses capture both the structure and temporal dynamics of social interactions, which are then directly tested using computational models sequentially predicting each foraging decision. These results reveal that adaptation mechanisms of both asocial foraging and selective social learning are driven by individual foraging success (rather than social factors). Furthermore, it is the degree of adaptivity---of both asocial and social learning---that best predicts individual performance. These findings not only integrate theories across asocial and social domains, but also provide key insights into the adaptability of human decision-making in complex and dynamic social landscapes.},

The present study aimed to investigate the characteristics of self-assessment practices at different SRL phases and its relationship with academic achievement. Using a course assignment as the learning task, sixty-three students enrolled in a one-year master programme in a teacher education institute responded to an instrument assessing their self-assessment practices (including four self-assessment actions) at the SRL Preparatory, Performance and Appraisal phases of the task. Their final scores of the assignment were also collected. The results showed that self-assessment is a fundamental skill for SRL and occurs at each SRL phase with different patterns. Autoregressive relationships were found for all self-assessment actions between different SRL phases. Self-reflection at Performance phase was found to influence feedback seeking at Appraisal phase. Self-directed feedback seeking through monitoring at Performance phase was the strongest and positive predictor of academic achievement; and achievement had negative impact on all self-assessment actions at Appraisal phase. This study may assist educators and researchers to better understand the complexity of self-assessment in relation to learning process.},

  abstract = {Educational technology innovations leveraging large language models (LLMs) have shown the potential to automate the laborious process of generating and analysing textual content. While various innovations have been developed to automate a range of educational tasks (e.g., question generation, feedback provision, and essay grading), there are concerns regarding the practicality and ethicality of these innovations. Such concerns may hinder future research and the adoption of LLMs-based innovations in authentic educational contexts. To address this, we conducted a systematic scoping review of 118 peer-reviewed papers published since 2017 to pinpoint the current state of research on using LLMs to automate and support educational tasks. The findings revealed 53 use cases for LLMs in automating education tasks, categorised into nine main categories: profiling/labelling, detection, grading, teaching support, prediction, knowledge representation, feedback, content generation, and recommendation. Additionally, we also identified several practical and ethical challenges, including low technological readiness, lack of replicability and transparency, and insufficient privacy and beneficence considerations. The findings were summarised into three recommendations for future studies, including updating existing innovations with state-of-the-art models (e.g., GPT-3/4), embracing the initiative of open-sourcing models/systems, and adopting a human-centred approach throughout the developmental process. As the intersection of AI and education is continuously evolving, the findings of this study can serve as an essential reference point for researchers, allowing them to leverage the strengths, learn from the limitations, and uncover potential research opportunities enabled by ChatGPT and other generative AI models.},

  abstract = {In this Editorial, we stay committed to the objective of the Journal of University Teaching and Learning Practice regarding sharing, evaluating, and developing stronger evidence-based practice papers by focusing on the topic of national and institutional student evaluations. We create an important theoretical and practical foundation for authors considering publishing with our Journal on studies that utilise student surveys as their primary method of data collection. The editorial begins by providing a comprehensive overview of the history and emergence of student evaluations dating back to medieval times, we trace the evolution of student evaluations to present day looking at the rationale behind the induction of such tools. Following this, we discuss the validity of student evaluations through an exploration of factors such as student satisfaction, the timing of when student surveys are administered, and the idiosyncrasies regarding paper-based and online evaluations. We then further discuss the reliability of student evaluations by contextualising what student evaluations do not say and uncover how various forms of bias can influence the ways student evaluations are both completed and interpreted. Through this we assert that due to confounding factors of bias that influence the results of student evaluations, they cannot always be thought of as wholly objective data collection tools. This then leads into our discussion of the contemporary social contexts within which student evaluations are situated and how both micro and macro dynamics influence student experiences of teaching and learning, where we contest that broader external factors experienced by students can skew the ways teaching is both perceived and evaluated. We conclude our Editorial by critically envisioning a new direction for future manuscript submissions to our Journal. We assert that although the use of student evaluations as evidence of teaching practice may be inherently flawed, there nonetheless remains merit in their use following critical and reflexive engagement throughout the research process. As such, we are hopeful that our critical review of student evaluation-based scholarship may be utilised to leverage higher quality research output.},

The research adopted a 2x2 counter-balance experimental design (Latin Square), whereby the participants were divided into two groups to write on two topics, receive feedback, and resubmit the revised work. The participants were 60 EFL secondary students and four teachers from a high school in China. All teachers and a Gen-AI bot (ChatGPT) marked and provided feedback on the 240 written samples. The analysis of the 1200 records (240*5) found that the AI-bot's surface-level feedback was comprehensive, accurate, and similar to that of one teacher. It outperformed the teacher qualitatively and quantitatively in the meaning-level feedback. Overall, teacher feedback received higher student uptake rates, but the difference was small. Students were capable of adopting a variety of strategies to respond to the feedback regardless of its sources. The findings support adopting ChatGPT feedback as a supplement to teacher feedback given to novice EFL writers.},

Teachers and parents expect mathematics homework to improve students' performance; however, studies have not clearly defined the effectiveness of the assignment of different amounts of homework. Aims This study analyses the differential effect of homework amount on various facets of Chinese students' mathematics achievement using a longitudinal design. It aims, thereby, to contribute to the existing knowledge of homework effectiveness and mathematics learning and to provide insights for student development. Sample The sample included 2383 grade 9 students from a mid-sized city with a moderate level of economic and educational development in central China. Methods We administered a student-reported questionnaire, collected school reports of mathematics achievements to track retrospective longitudinal variations in mathematics over half a year and analysed the differential effectiveness of homework on mathematics achievement at four hierarchical cognitive levels with Hierarchical Linear Model. Results The results indicated that assigning more homework at the class level could enhance students' mathematics achievement at a low cognitive level, although this effectiveness tended to disappear when the set homework time reached about 1.5--2 h. We did not find evidence that assigning more homework enhances students' mathematics achievement at higher cognitive levels. Conclusions Overall, this study provides evidence on the effectiveness of homework and offers implications for educational practice and future research.},
